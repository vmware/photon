The guide also includes a section to get you started using Photon OS quickly and easily. \nPhoton OS is a Linux container host optimized for vSphere and cloud-computing platforms such as Amazon Elastic Compute and Google Compute Engine. As a lightweight and extensible operating system, Photon OS works with the most common container formats, including Docker, Rocket, and Garden. Photon OS includes a yum-compatible, package-based lifecycle management system called tdnf.\nWhen used with development tools and environments such as VMware Fusion, VMware Workstation, HashiCorp (Vagrant and Atlas), and production runtime environments (vSphere, vCloud Air), Photon OS lets you seamlessly migrate container-based applications from development to production. With a small footprint and fast boot and run times, Photon OS is optimized for cloud computing and cloud  applications.  \nThere are two versions of Photon OS: a minimal version and a full version. \nThe minimal version of Photon OS is lightweight container host runtime environment best suited to managing and hosting containers. The minimal version contains just enough packaging and functionality to manage and modify containers while remaining a fast runtime environment. The minimal version is ready to work with appliances. \nThe full version of Photon OS includes additional packages to help you customize the system and create containerized applications. For  running containers, the full version is excessive. The full version is targeted at helping you create, develop, test, and package an application that runs a container. \nTwo characteristics of Photon OS stand out: It manages services with systemd and it manages packages with an open source, yum-compatible package manager called tdnf, for Tiny DNF. \nBy using systemd, Photon OS adopts a contemporary Linux standard to manage system services. Photon OS bootstraps the user space and concurrently starts services with systemd. The systemctl utility controls services on Photon OS. For example, instead of running the /etc/init.d/ssh script to stop and start the OpenSSH server on a init.d-based Linux system, you run the following systemctl commands on Photon OS: \nsystemctl stop sshd\nsystemctl start sshd\nTdnf keeps the operating system as small as possible while preserving yum's robust package-management capabilities. On Photon OS, tdnf is the default package manager for installing new packages. It is a C implementation of DNF package manager. \nExamining the Packages in the SPECS Directory on Github\nThe SPECS directory of the GitHub website for Photon OS contains all the packages that can appear in Photon OS repositories:  \nhttps://github.com/vmware/photon/tree/master/SPECS\nTo see the version of a package, in the SPECS directory, click the name of the subdirectory of the package that you want to examine, and then click the .spec filename in the subdirectory. For example, the version of OpenJDK, which contains the openjre package that installs the Java class library and the javac Java compiler, looks like this: \n\n%define _use_internal_dependency_generator 0\nSummary:    OpenJDK \nName:        openjdk\nVersion:    1.8.0.72\nRelease:    1%{?dist}\nLicense:    GNU GPL\nURL:        https://openjdk.java.net\nGroup:        Development/Tools\nVendor:        VMware, Inc.\nDistribution:   Photon\nAutoReqProv:     no\nSource0:    http://anduin.linuxfromscratch.org/files/BLFS/OpenJDK-%{version}/OpenJDK-%{version}-x86_64-bin.tar.xz\n%define sha1 OpenJDK=0c705d7b13f4e22611d2da654209f469a6297f26\n%description\nThe OpenJDK package installs java class library and javac java compiler. \n\n%package    -n openjre\nSummary:    Jave runtime environment\nAutoReqProv:     no\n%description    -n openjre\nIt contains the libraries files for Java runtime environment\n#%global __requires_exclude ^libgif.*$\n#%filter_from_requires ^libgif.*$...\n...\n\n\nLooking at the Differences Between the Minimal and the Full Version\nThe minimal version of Photon OS contains about 50 packages. As it is installed, the number of packages increases to nearly 100 to fulfill dependencies. The full version of Photon OS adds several hundred packages to those in the minimal version to deliver a more fully featured operating system. \nYou can view a list of the packages that appear in the minimal version by examining the following file: \nhttps://github.com/vmware/photon/blob/master/common/data/packages_minimal.json\nYou can view a list of the packages that appear in the full version by examining the following file: \nhttps://github.com/vmware/photon/blob/master/common/data/packages_full.json\nIf the minimal or the full version of Photon OS does not contain a package that you want, you can of course install it with tdnf, which appears in both the minimal and full versions of Photon OS by default. In the full version of Photon OS, you can also install packages by using yum. \nOne notable difference between the two versions of Photon OS pertains to OpenJDK, the package that contains not only the Java runtime environment (openjre) but also the Java compiler (javac). The OpenJDK package appears in the full but not the minimal version of Photon OS. To add support for Java programs to the minimal version of Photon OS, install the Java packages and their dependencies: \ntdnf install openjdk\nInstalling:\nopenjre     x86_64    1.8.0.92-1.ph1    95.09 M\nopenjdk     x86_64    1.8.0.92-1.ph1    37.63 M\nNOTE: openjdk and openjre are available as openjdk8 and openjre8 in Photon OS 2.0\nA later section covers tdnf. \nThe Root Account and the sudo and su Commands\nThis guide assumes that you are logged in to Photon OS with the root account and running commands as root. The sudo program comes with the full version of Photon OS. On the minimal version, you must install sudo with tdnf if you want to use it. As an alternative to installing sudo on the minimal version, you can switch users as needed with the su command to run commands that require root privileges. \nGetting Started with Photon OS 2.0\nNOTE: This section applies to Photon OS 2.0 only.\nTo get started with Photon OS 2.0, refer to the installation instructions for your target environment:\n\nRunning Photon OS on VMware vSphere\nRunning Photon OS on VMware Fusion\nRunning Photon OS on VMware Workstation\nRunning Photon OS on Amazon EC2\nRunning Photon OS on Google Compute Engine\nRunning Photon OS on Microsoft Azure\n\nNote: If you want to upgrade an existing Photon 1.0 VM, refer to the instructions in Upgrading to Photon OS 2.0. \nQuick Start for Photon OS 1.0\nNOTE: This section applies to Photon OS 1.0 only.\nThis section helps you get Photon OS up and running quickly and easily. There are several ways to deploy Photon OS for free within a matter of minutes:\n\nObtain the ISO from Bintray and use it to create a virtual machine running Photon OS.\nInstall the OVA for the minimal version of Photon OS in VMware vSphere.\nRapidly deploy the OVA for the minimal version of Photon OS in VMware Workstation 12 Pro. \n\nObtaining the ISO from Bintray and Creating a Photon OS VM in VMware Workstation\nThe full version of Photon OS installs from an ISO in VMware Workstation and other hypervisors in a matter of minutes. Photon OS is a free download from the Bintray web site.\nThis section demonstrates how to create a virtual machine running Photon OS in VMware Workstation 12 Pro. If you are using a different hypervisor, the example set by this section should help you install it in your system. For instructions on how to install Photon OS from an ISO in VMware vSphere, see Installing Photon OS on VMware vSphere from an ISO Image.\n\nGo to the following Bintray URL and download the ISO for the general availability release of Photon OS:\n https://bintray.com/vmware/photon/iso/view\n\nIn VMware Workstation, type Ctrl+N to create a new virtual machine. \n\nIn the New Virtual Machine Wizard, select Typical, and then click Next.\n\nSelect Installer disk image file (iso), click Browse to locate the Photon OS ISO that you downloaded from Bintray, and then click Next.\n\nFor the guest operating system, select Linux. From the Version drop-down menu, select VMware Photon 64-bit. If you have an older version of VMware Workstation and Photon does not appear in the list, select Other Linux 3.x kernel 64-bit.\n\n\nClick Next through the remaining dialog boxes of the wizard,  either accepting the default settings, which is recommended, or making the changes that you want, and then click Finish.\n\nPower on the virtual machine and, in the Workstation window containing Photon, press Enter to start the installation.\n\n\nDuring disk setup, the installer might ask you to confirm that this will erase the disk. If so, accept the default value of yes by hitting your Enter key.\n\nSelect the installation that you want. For this example, choose Photon Full by using the tab key to move to Photon Full and then hitting the space bar to select it. Press Enter to install it. \n\nEither accept the default hostname that Photon provides or type the name that you want. Press Enter to continue. \n\nType the root password. Photon OS requires the root password to be a complex string containing no common words or names.\n\n\nThe installation typically completes in about 150 seconds for the full version and in less than 30 seconds for the minimal version. After the installation finishes, boot the system and log in as root with your root password. \nTo connect to Photon OS by SSH, see the section on permitting root login with SSH below.  \nYou can also build an ISO containing Photon OS from its source code on GitHub by following the instructions in the document on building Photon OS. \nInstalling the OVA for the Minimal Version in vSphere\nYou can download the OVA for the minimal version of Photon OS from Bintray and deploy it in vSphere in a matter of seconds. Here's how: \nDownload the OVA for the minimal version of Photon OS from the following URL: \nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/ova\nTo install the OVA in vSphere, on the File menu, click Deploy OVF Template, and then click Browse to locate the image that you downloaded. Move through the Deploy OVF Template dialog boxes by clicking Next to accept the default settings, and then click Finish. \nIn vSphere Client, turn on the power of the Photon OS virtual machine and open a console to it.\nThe default password for the root account is changeme, and you must change it when you first login. For security, Photon OS forbids common dictionary words for the root password. \nThere are other options for installing Photon OS in vSphere, such as building an ISO from the source code. For more information about the versions of Photon and their installation options, see Running Photon OS on vSphere.\nRapidly Deploying the Photon OS OVA in VMware Workstation 12 Pro\nHere's how to rapidly deploy the OVA for Photon in VMware Workstation 12 Pro by using an up-to-date version of Firefox. The procedure in other browsers or another version of Workstation might be different. \nIn Firefox, download the OVA for the minimal version of Photon OS from this URL: \nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/ova\nIn the download dialog box, select Open with VMware Workstation (default), like this:\n\nIn the Workstation Import dialog box, click Import.\n\nWorkstation creates a virtual machine from the Photon OS OVA template in a few seconds. In Workstation, power on the virtual machine and log in as root with the initial password of changeme.\nPhoton OS then prompts you to change the root password.  \nRoot Password Rules\nWhen you first log on a new Photon OS machine, you must set the root password to a complex string containing no common words or names. Photon OS rejects a root password that contains simplistic patterns, common words, or words derived from the name of your account. The rules apply only to the root password, not other user and group accounts. \nPermitting Root Login with SSH\nThe full version of Photon OS prevents root login with SSH by default. To permit root login over SSH, open /etc/ssh/sshd_config with the vim text editor and set PermitRootLogin to yes. \nVim is the default text editor available in both the full and minimal versions of Photon OS. (Nano is also in the full version.) After you modify the SSH daemon's configuration file, you must restart the sshd daemon for the changes to take effect. Example: \nvim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n# override default of no subsystems\nSubsystem       sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server\n\n# Example of overriding settings on a per-user basis\n#Match User anoncvs\n#       X11Forwarding no\n#       AllowTcpForwarding no\n#       PermitTTY no\n#       ForceCommand cvs server\nPermitRootLogin yes\nUsePAM yes\nSave your changes in vim and then restart the sshd daemon: \nsystemctl restart sshd\nYou can then connect to the Photon OS machine with the root account over SSH:\nsteve@ubuntu:~$ ssh root@198.51.100.131\nPXE Boot\nPhoton OS works with the Preboot Execution Environment, or PXE, to boot by retrieving software from a PXE server over a network connection. For instructions on how to set Photon OS to boot from a PXE server, see Network PXE Boot.\nKickstart\nPhoton OS supports kickstart for unattended installations through a CD-ROM or an HTTP server. On Photon OS, kickstart can set the hostname, password, run post-installation scripts, and add public keys for SSH. See Kickstart Support.\nChecking the Version and Build Number\nTo check the version and build number of Photon OS, concatenate /etc/photon-release. Example: \ncat /etc/photon-release\nVMware Photon Linux 1.0\nPHOTON_BUILD_NUMBER=a6f0f63\nThe build number in the results maps to the commit number on the VMware Photon OS GitHub commits page.\nTiny DNF for Package Management\nOn Photon OS, Tiny DNF, for Tiny Dandified Yum, is the default package manager for installing new packages. It is a C implementation of DNF package manager. The standard syntax for tdnf commands is the same as that for DNF: \ntdnf [options]  [...]\nYou can view its help information like this: \ntdnf --help\ntdnf -h\nPhoton OS 1.0 only: In the minimal version of Photon OS, tdnf serves as the sole package manager to streamline the operating system. The full version of Photon OS includes yum, a common utility that checks for, downloads, and automatically installs RPM packages. On the minimal version of Photon OS, you can install yum by using tdnf if you are unconcerned with the size of the operating system: tdnf install yum\nConfiguration Files and Repositories\nThe main configuration files reside in /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf. The configuration file looks like this: \ncat /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf\n[main]\ngpgcheck=1\ninstallonly_limit=3\nclean_requirements_on_remove=true\nrepodir=/etc/yum.repos.d\ncachedir=/var/cache/tdnf\nThe cache files for data and metadata reside in /var/cache/tdnf. \nThe repositories appear in /etc/yum.repos.d/ with .repo file extensions:\nls /etc/yum.repos.d/\nlightwave.repo\nphoton-extras.repo\nphoton-iso.repo\nphoton-updates.repo\nphoton.repo \nNote: Photon OS 1.0 (only) also includes the lightwave.repo.\nYou can list the the repositories by using the tdnf repolist command. Tdnf filters the results with enabled, disabled, and all. Running the command without specifying an argument returns the enabled repositories:  \ntdnf repolist\nrepo id             repo name                               status\nphoton-updates      VMware Photon Linux 2.0(x86_64)Updates  enabled\nphoton-extras       VMware Photon Extras 2.0(x86_64)        enabled\nphoton              VMware Photon Linux 2.0(x86_64)         enabled\nNote: Photon OS 1.0 (only) also includes the lightwave repository.\nThe photon-iso.repo, however, does not appear in the list of repositories because it is unavailable on the virtual machine from which these examples are taken. Photon-iso.repo is the default repository; it points to /media/cdrom. The contents of photon-iso.repo look like this: \ncat /etc/yum.repos.d/photon-iso.repo\n[photon-iso]\nname=VMWare Photon Linux 2.0(x86_64)\nbaseurl=file:///mnt/cdrom/RPMS\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/VMWARE-RPM-GPG-KEY\ngpgcheck=1\nenabled=0\nskip_if_unavailable=True\nThe local cache is populated with data from the repository: \nls -l /var/cache/tdnf/photon\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 May 18 22:52 repodata\nd-wxr----t 3 root root 4096 May  3 22:51 rpms\nYou can clear the cache to help troubleshoot a problem, but keep in mind that doing so might slow the performance of tdnf until the cache becomes repopulated with data. Here is how to clear the cache: \ntdnf clean all\nCleaning repos: photon photon-extras photon-updates lightwave\nCleaning up everything\nThe command purges the repository data from the cache: \nls -l /var/cache/tdnf/photon\ntotal 4\nd-wxr----t 3 root root 4096 May  3 22:51 rpms\nOptions for Commands\nYou can add the following options to tdnf commands. If the option to override a configuration is unavailable in a command, consider adding it to the configuration file, /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf.\nOPTION                     DESCRIPTION\n--allowerasing             Allow erasing of installed packages to resolve dependencies\n--assumeno                 Answer no for all questions\n--best                     Try the best available package versions in transactions\n--debugsolver              Dump data aiding in dependency solver debugging info.\n--disablerepo=     Disable specific repositories by an id or a glob.\n--enablerepo=      Enable specific repositories\n-h, --help                 Display help\n--refresh                  Set metadata as expired before running command\n--nogpgcheck               Skip gpg check on packages\n--rpmverbosity=\n                           Debug level for rpm\n--version                  Print version and exit\n-y, --assumeyes            Answer yes to all questions\n-q, --quiet                Quiet operation\nHere is an example that adds the short form of the assumeyes option to the install command:\ntdnf -y install gcc\nUpgrading:\ngcc     x86_64    5.3.0-1.ph1     91.35 M\nCommands\ncheck: Checks for problems in installed and available packages for all enabled repositories. Command has no arguments. You can use --enablerepo and --disablerepo to control the repos used. Supported in Photon OS 2.0 (only).\ncheck-local: This command resolves dependencies by using the local RPMs to help check RPMs for quality assurance before publishing them. To check RPMs with this command, you must create a local directory and place your RPMs in it. The command, which includes no options, takes the path to the local directory containing the RPMs as its argument. The command does not, however, recursively parse directories; it checks the RPMs only in the directory that you specify. For example, after creating a directory named /tmp/myrpms and placing your RPMs in it, you can run the following command to check them:  \ntdnf check-local /tmp/myrpms\nChecking all packages from: /tmp/myrpms\nFound 10 packages\nCheck completed without issues\ncheck-update: This command checks for updates to packages. It takes no arguments. The tdnf list updates command performs the same function. Here is an example of the check update command: \ntdnf check-update\nrpm-devel.x86_64     4.11.2-8.ph1     photon\nyum.noarch          3.4.3-3.ph1     photon\nclean: This command cleans up temporary files, data, and metadata. It takes the argument all. Example: \ntdnf clean all\nCleaning repos: photon photon-extras photon-updates lightwave\nCleaning up everything\ndistro-sync: This command synchronizes the machine's RPMs with the latest version of all the packages in the repository. Abridged example:\ntdnf distro-sync\n\nUpgrading:\nzookeeper                             x86_64        3.4.8-2.ph1               3.38 M\nyum                                   noarch        3.4.3-3.ph1               4.18 M\n\nTotal installed size: 113.01 M\n\nReinstalling:\nzlib-devel                            x86_64        1.2.8-2.ph1             244.25 k\nzlib                                  x86_64        1.2.8-2.ph1             103.93 k\nyum-metadata-parser                   x86_64        1.1.4-1.ph1              57.10 k\n\nTotal installed size: 1.75 G\n\nObsoleting:\ntftp                                  x86_64        5.2-3.ph1                32.99 k\n\nTotal installed size: 32.99 k\nIs this ok [y/N]:\ndowngrade: This command downgrades the package that you specify as an argument to the next lower package version. Example: \ntdnf downgrade boost\nDowngrading:\nboost                                 x86_64        1.56.0-2.ph1              8.20 M\nTotal installed size: 8.20 M\nIs this ok [y/N]:y\nDownloading:\nboost                                  2591470    100%\nTesting transaction\nRunning transaction\nComplete!\nTo downgrade to a version lower than the next one, you must specify it by name, epoch, version, and release, all properly hyphenated. Example: \ntdnf downgrade boost-1.56.0-2.ph1 \nerase: This command removes the package that you specify as an argument. Example: \ntdnf erase vim\nRemoving:\nvim                                   x86_64        7.4-4.ph1                 1.94 M\nTotal installed size: 1.94 M\nIs this ok [y/N]:\nYou can also erase multiple packages: \ntdnf erase docker cloud-init\ninfo: This command displays information about packages. It can take the name of a package. Or it can take one of the following arguments: all, available, installed, extras, obsoletes, recent, upgrades. Examples: \ntdnf info ruby\ntdnf info obsoletes\ntdnf info upgrades\ninstall: This command takes the name of a package as its argument. It then installs the package and its dependencies. Examples: \ntdnf install kubernetes\nYou can also install multiple packages: \ntdnf install python-curses lsof audit gettext chkconfig ntsysv bindutils \n     wget gawk irqbalance lvm2 cifs-utils c-ares distrib-compat\nlist: This command lists the packages of the package that you specify as the argument. The command can take one of the following arguments: all, available, installed, extras, obsoletes, recent, upgrades. \ntdnf list updates\nThe list of packages might be long. To more easily view it, you can concatenate it into a text file, and then open the text file in a text editor: \ntdnf list all > pkgs.txt\nvi pkgs.txt\nmakecache: This command updates the cached binary metadata for all known repositories. Example:\ntdnf makecache\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)Updates'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Extras 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)'\nMetadata cache created.\nprovides: This command finds the packages that provide the package that you supply as an argument. Examples: \ntdnf provides docker\ndocker-1.11.0-1.ph1.x86_64 : Docker\nRepo     : photon\ndocker-1.11.0-1.ph1.x86_64 : Docker\nRepo     : @System\nreinstall: This command reinstalls the packages that you specify. If some packages are unavailable or not installed, the command fails. Example: \ntdnf reinstall docker kubernetes\n\nReinstalling:\nkubernetes                            x86_64        1.1.8-1.ph1             152.95 M\ndocker                                x86_64        1.11.0-1.ph1             57.20 M\n\nTotal installed size: 210.15 M\nremove: This command removes a package. When removing a package, tdnf by default also removes dependencies that are no longer used if they were was installed by tdnf as a dependency without being explicitly requested by a user. You can modify the dependency removal by changing the clean_requirements_on_remove option in /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf to false. \ntdnf remove packagename\nsearch: This command searches for the attributes of packages. The argument can be the names of packages, as this example testifies: \ntdnf search docker kubernetes\ndocker : Docker\ndocker : Docker\ndocker-debuginfo : Debug information for package docker\ndocker : Docker\nkubernetes : Kubernetes cluster management\nkubernetes : Kubernetes cluster management\nkubernetes-debuginfo : Debug information for package kubernetes\nkubernetes : Kubernetes cluster management\nThe argument of the search command can also be a keyword or a combination of keywords and packages: \ntdnf search terminal bash\nrubygem-terminal-table : Simple, feature rich ascii table generation library\nncurses : Libraries for terminal handling of character screens\nmingetty : A minimal getty program for virtual terminals\nncurses : Libraries for terminal handling of character screens\nncurses : Libraries for terminal handling of character screens\nbash : Bourne-Again SHell\nbash-lang : Additional language files for bash\nbash-lang : Additional language files for bash\nbash : Bourne-Again SHell\nbash-debuginfo : Debug information for package bash\nbash : Bourne-Again SHell\nbash-lang : Additional language files for bash\nupgrade: This command upgrades the package or packages that you specify to an available higher version that tdnf can resolve. If the package is already the latest version, the command returns Nothing to do. Example: \ntdnf upgrade boost\n\nUpgrading:\nboost                                 x86_64        1.60.0-1.ph1              8.11 M\n\nTotal installed size: 8.11 M\nIs this ok [y/N]:y\n\nDownloading:\nboost                                  2785950    100%\nTesting transaction\nRunning transaction\n\nComplete!\nYou can also run the upgrade command with the refresh option to update the cached metadata with the latest information from the repositories. The following example refreshes the metadata and then checks for a new version of tdnf but does not find one, so tdnf takes no action: \ntdnf upgrade tdnf --refresh\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)Updates'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Extras 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)'\nNothing to do.\nupgrade-to: This command upgrades to the version of the package that you specify. Example:\ntdnf upgrade-to ruby2.3\nThe commands and options of tdnf are, at present, a subset of those of dnf. For more help with tdnf commands, see the DNF documentation.\nAdding a New Repository\nWith Photon OS, you can add a new repository from which tdnf installs packages. To do so, you create a repository configuration file with a .repo extension and place it in /etc/yum.repos.d. The repository can be on either the Internet or a local server containing your in-house applications. \nBe careful if you add a repository that's on the Internet: Installing packages from untrusted or unverified sources might put the security, stability, or compatibility of your system at risk. It might also make your system harder to maintain.  \nOn Photon OS, the existing repositories appear in /etc/yum.repos.d:\nls /etc/yum.repos.d/\nlightwave.repo\nphoton-extras.repo\nphoton-iso.repo\nphoton-updates.repo\nphoton.repo \nLooking at one of the .repo files reveals the format and information that a new repository configuration file should contain:\ncat /etc/yum.repos.d/lightwave.repo\n[lightwave]\nname=VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)\nbaseurl=https://dl.bintray.com/vmware/lightwave\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/VMWARE-RPM-GPG-KEY\ngpgcheck=1\nenabled=1\nskip_if_unavailable=True\nThe minimal information needed to establish a repository is an ID and human-readable name of the repository and its base URL. The ID, which appears in square brackets, must be one word that is unique amoung the system's repositories; in the example above, it is [lightwave].\nThe baseurl is a URL for the repository's repodata directory. For a repository on a local server that can be accessed directly or mounted as a file system, the base URL can be a file referenced by file://. Example:  \nbaseurl=file:///server/repo/\nThe gpgcheck setting specifies whether to check the GPG signature. The gpgkey setting furnishes the URL for the repository's ASCII-armored GPG key file. Tdnf uses the GPG key to verify a package if its key has not been imported into the RPM database.\nThe enabled setting tells tdnf whether to poll the repository. If enabled is set to 1, tdnf polls it; if it is set to 0, tdnf ignores it. \nThe skip_if_unavailable setting instructs tdnf to continue running if the repository goes offline.\nOther options and variables can appear in the repository file. The variables that go with some of the options can reduce future changes to the repository configuration files. There are variables to replace the value of the version of the package and to replace the base architecture. For more information, see the man page for yum.conf on the full version of Photon OS: man yum.conf\nHere is an example of how to add a new repository for a local server that tdnf polls for packages:\ncat > /etc/yum.repos.d/apps.repo Because this new repository resides on a local server, make sure the Photon OS machine can connect to it by, for instance, mounting it. \nAfter establishing a new repository, you must run the following command to update the cached binary metadata for the repositories that tdnf polls. Example:\ntdnf makecache\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)Updates'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Extras 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'Local In-House Applications(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)'\nMetadata cache created.\nAdding the Dev Repository to Get New Packages from the GitHub Dev Branch\nIf you want to try out new packages or the latest versions of existing packages as they are merged into the dev branch of the Photon OS GitHub site, you can add the dev repository to your repository list. Here's how: \nOn your Photon OS machine, run the following command as root to create a repository configuration file named photon-dev.repo, place it in /etc/yum.repos.d, and concatenate the repository's information into the file: \ncat > /etc/yum.repos.d/photon-dev.repo After establishing a new repository, you must run the following command to update the cached binary metadata for the repositories that tdnf polls:\ntdnf makecache\nManaging Services with systemd\nPhoton OS manages services with systemd. By using systemd, Photon OS adopts a contemporary Linux standard to bootstrap the user space and concurrently start services--an architecture that differs from traditional Linux systems such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. \nA traditional Linux system contains an initialization system called SysVinit. With SLES 11, for instance, SysVinit-style init programs control how the system starts up and shuts down. Init implements system runlevels. A SysVinit runlevel defines a state in which a  process or service runs. \nIn contrast to a SysVinit system, systemd defines no such runlevels. Instead, systemd uses a dependency tree of targets to determine which services to start when. Combined with the declarative nature of systemd commands, systemd targets reduce the amount of code needed to run a command, leaving you with code that is easier to maintain and probably faster to execute. For an overview of systemd, see systemd System and Service Manager and the man page for systemd.\nOn Photon OS, you should manage services with systemd and its command-line utility for inspecting and controlling the system, systemctl, not the deprecated commands of init.d. \nThe following sections present a brief overview of useful systemctl commands and options for examining and managing the state of systemd services. For more information, see the index of all the systemd man pages, including systemctl, at the following URL: \nhttps://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/\nViewing Services\nTo view a description of all the active, loaded units, execute the systemctl command without any options or arguments: \nsystemctl\nTo see all the loaded, active, and inactive units and their description, run this command: \nsystemctl --all\nTo see all the unit files and their current status but no description, run this command: \nsystemctl list-unit-files\nThe grep command filters the services by a search term, a helpful tactic to recall the exact name of a unit file without looking through a long list of names. Example: \nsystemctl list-unit-files | grep network\norg.freedesktop.network1.busname           static\ndbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service      enabled\nsystemd-networkd-wait-online.service       enabled\nsystemd-networkd.service                   enabled\nsystemd-networkd.socket                    enabled\nnetwork-online.target                      static\nnetwork-pre.target                         static\nnetwork.target                             static\nControlling Services\nTo control services on Photon OS, you use systemctl. For example, instead of running the /etc/init.d/ssh script to stop and start the OpenSSH server on a init.d-based Linux system, you run the following systemctl commands on Photon OS: \nsystemctl stop sshd\nsystemctl start sshd\nThe systemctl tool includes a range of commands and options for inspecting and controlling the state of systemd and the service manager; for more information, see the systemctl man page.\nCreating a Startup Service\nThis section shows you how to create a systemd startup service that changes the maximum transmission unit, or MTU, of the default Ethernet connection, eth0.\nFirst, concatenate the following block of code into a file: \ncat > /lib/systemd/system/eth0.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Network interface initialization\nAfter=local-fs.target network-online.target network.target\nWants=local-fs.target network-online.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/bin/ifconfig eth0 mtu 1460 up\nType=oneshot\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nEOF\nSecond, set the service to auto-start when the system boots: \ncd /lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/\nln -s ../eth0.service eth0.service\nDisabling the Photon OS httpd.service\nIf your application or appliance includes its own HTTP server, you should turn off and disable the HTTP server that comes with Photon OS so that it does not conflict with your own HTTP server. \nTo stop it and disable it, run the following commands as root: \nsystemctl stop httpd.service\nsystemctl disable httpd.service\nAuditing System Events with auditd\nBecause Photon OS emphasizes security, the Linux auditing service, auditd, is enabled and active by default on the full version of Photon OS: \nsystemctl status auditd\n* auditd.service - Security Auditing Service\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/auditd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Fri 2016-04-29 15:08:50 UTC; 1 months 9 days ago\n Main PID: 250 (auditd)\n   CGroup: /system.slice/auditd.service\n           `-250 /sbin/auditd -n\nTo help improve security, the auditd service can monitor file changes, system calls, executed commands, authentication events, and network access. After you implement an audit rule to monitor an event, the aureport tool generates reports to display information about the events. \nYou can, for instance, use the auditctl utility to set a rule that monitors the sudoers file for changes:\nauditctl -w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k sudoers_changes\nThis rule specifies that the auditd service watch (-w) the /etc/sudoers file to log permissions changes (p) to the write access (w) or attributes (a) of the file and to identify them in logs as sudoers_changes. The auditing logs appear in /var/log/audit/audit.log. You can list the auditing rules like this: \nauditctl -l\n-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k sudoers_changes\nFor more information on the Linux Audit Daemon, see its man page on Photon OS: \nman auditd\nFor more information on setting auditing rules and options with auditctl, see its man page:\nman auditctl\nFor more information on viewing reports on audited events, see the aureport man page:\nman aureport\nAnalyzing systemd Logs with journalctl\nThe journalctl tool queries the contents of the systemd journal. For help troubleshooting systemd, two journalctl queries are particularly useful: showing the log entries for the last boot and showing the log entries for a systemd service unit. \nThis command displays the messages that systemd generated during the last time the machine started: \njournalctl -b\nThis command reveals the messages for only the systemd service unit specified by the -u option, which is auditd in the following example: \njournalctl -u auditd\nFor more information, see the journalctl man page by running this command on Photon OS: man journalctl\nMigrating Scripts to systemd\nAlthough systemd maintains compatibility with init.d scripts, you should, as a best practice, adapt the scripts that you want to run on Photon OS to systemd to avoid potential problems. Such a conversion standardizes the scripts, reduces the footprint of your code, makes the scripts easier to read and maintain, and improves their robustness on a systemd system.\nManaging the Network Configuration\nThe network service, which is enabled by default, starts when the system boots. You manage the network service by using systemd commands, such as systemd-networkd, systemd-resolvd, and networkctl. You can check its status of the network service by running the following command: \nsystemctl status systemd-networkd\nHere is a healthy result of the command: \n* systemd-networkd.service - Network Service\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Fri 2016-04-29 15:08:51 UTC; 6 days ago\n     Docs: man:systemd-networkd.service(8)\n Main PID: 291 (systemd-network)\n   Status: \"Processing requests...\"\n   CGroup: /system.slice/systemd-networkd.service\n           `-291 /lib/systemd/systemd-networkd\nBecause Photon OS relies on systemd to manage services, you should employ the systemd suite of commands, not deprecated init.d commands or other deprecated commands, to manage networking. \nUsing the Photon Management Daemon\nThe Photon Management Daemon (PMD) that ships with Photon OS 2.0 provides the remote management of a Photon instance via several APIs: a command line client (pmd-cli), a REST API, and a Python API. The PMD provides the ability to manage network interfaces, packages, firewalls, users, and user groups.\nInstalling the pmd Package\nThe pmd package is included with your Photon OS 2.0 distribution. To make sure that you have the latest version, you can run:\n# tdnf install pmd\n# systemctl start pmd\nAvailable APIs\npmd-cli\nThe pmd-cli utility enables Photon customers to invoke API requests securely on local and remote servers. For details, see Photon Management Daemon Command-line Interface (pmd-cli).\nPMD REST API\nThe PMD REST API is an openapi 2.0 specification. Once the pmd package is installed, you can use a Swagger UI tool to browse the REST API specifications (/etc/pmd/restapispec.json).\nYou can also browse it using the copenapi_cli tool that comes with the pmd package:\n# copenapi_cli --apispec /etc/pmd/restapispec.json\nFor more information about the copenapi_cli tool, refer to github.com/vmware/copenapi.\nPMD Python API\nPython3 is included with your Photon OS 2.0 distribution. PMD Python interfaces are available for python3 (pmd-python3) and python2 (pmd-python2). You can use tdnf to ensure that the latest version is installed:\n# tdnf install pmd-python3\n# systemctl start pmd\nTo navigate the help documentation for the pmd Python packages:\n# python3\n>>> import pmd\n>>> net = pmd.server().net\n>>> help(pmd)\nTo show help text for individual interfaces:\n>>> help(pmd.server().net)\n>>> help(pmd.server().pkg)\n>>> help(pmd.server().firewall)\n>>> help(pmd.server().user)\nFor details about the network commands, see also the Network Configuration Manager - Python API.\nPMD C Documentation\nPMD C APIs are defined in the header files (pmd_fwmgmt.h, pmd_netmgr.h, pmd_pkgmgmt.h, pmd_usermgmt.h) that are stored in the following location:  \n[https://github.com/vmware/pmd/tree/master/include](https://github.com/vmware/pmd/tree/master/include)\nFor details about the network commands, see also the Network Configuration Manager - C API.\nUsing the Network Configuration Manager\nThe Network Configuration Manager library that ships with Photon OS 2.0 provides a collection of C, Python, and CLI APIs that simplify common onfiguration tasks for:\n\ninterfaces\nIP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses)\nroutes\nDNS server and domain settings\nDHCP DUID and IAID settings\nNTP server settings\nservice management\nobject parameters (interfaces and files)\n\nFor additional details, see:\n\nCLI - see the -net commands in the Photon Management Daemon Command-line Interface (pmd-cli)\nC APIs - Network Configuration Manager - C API\nPython APIs - Network Configuration Manager - Python API\n\nUse ip and ss Commands Instead of ifconfig and netstat\nAlthough the ifconfig command and the netstat command work on Photon OS, VMware recommends that you use the ip or ss commands. The ipconfig and netstat commands are deprecated. \nFor example, instead of running netstat to display a list of network interfaces, run the ss command. Similarly, to display information for IP addresses, instead of running ifconfig -a, run the ip addr command. Examples:\nUSE THIS IPROUTE COMMAND     INSTEAD OF THIS NET-TOOL COMMAND\nip addr                     ifconfig -a\nss                             netstat\nip route                     route\nip maddr                     netstat -g\nip link set eth0 up         ifconfig eth0 up\nip -s neigh                    arp -v\nip link set eth0 mtu 9000    ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000\nUsing the ip route version of a command instead of the net-tools version often provides more complete, accurate information on Photon OS, as the following example demonstrates: \nip neigh\n198.51.100.2 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:e2:02:0f STALE\n198.51.100.254 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:e7:13:d9 STALE\n198.51.100.1 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:c0:00:08 DELAY\n\narp -a\n? (198.51.100.2) at 00:50:56:e2:02:0f [ether] on eth0\n? (198.51.100.254) at 00:50:56:e7:13:d9 [ether] on eth0\n? (198.51.100.1) at 00:50:56:c0:00:08 [ether] on eth0\nConfiguring Network Interfaces\nNetwork configuration files for systemd-networkd reside in /etc/systemd/network and /usr/lib/systemd/network. Example:\nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# ls /etc/systemd/network/\n99-dhcp-en.network\nBy default, when Photon OS starts, it creates a DHCP network configuration file, or rule, which appears in /etc/systemd/network, the highest priority directory for network configuration files with the lowest priority filename:\ncat /etc/systemd/network/99-dhcp-en.network\n[Match]\nName=e*\n\n[Network]\nDHCP=yes\nNetwork configuration files can also appear in the system network directory, /usr/lib/systemd/network, as the results of the following search illustrate:\nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# updatedb\nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# locate systemd/network\n/etc/systemd/network\n/etc/systemd/network/99-dhcp-en.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-ve.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]#\nAs you can see, the /usr/lib/systemd/network directory contains several network configuration files. Photon OS applies the configuration files in the lexicographical order specified by the file names without regard for the network configuration directory in which the file resides unless the file name is the same. Photon OS processes files with identical names by giving precedence to files in the /etc directory over the other directory. Thus, the settings in /etc/systemd/network override those in /usr/lib/systemd/network. Once Photon OS matches an interface in a file, Photon OS ignores the interface if it appears in files processed later in the lexicographical order. \nEach .network file contains a matching rule and a configuration that Photon OS applies when a device matches the rule. You set the matching rule and the configuration as sections containing vertical sets of key-value pairs according to the information at https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.network.html. \nTo configure Photon OS to handle a networking use case, such as setting a static IP address or adding a name server, you create a configuration file with a .network extension and place it in the /etc/systemd/network directory.\nAfter you create a network configuration file with a .network extension, you must run the chmod command to set the new file's mode bits to 644. Example: \nchmod 644 10-static-en.network\nFor Photon OS to apply the new configuration, you must restart the systemd-networkd service by running the following command: \nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nFor information about network configuration files, their processing order, and their matching rules, sections, and keys, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.network.html.\nFor information about creating virtual network device files (.netdev), see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.netdev.html.\nSetting a Static IP Address\nBefore you set a static IP address, obtain the name of your Ethernet link by running the following command: \nnetworkctl\nIDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP\n  1 lo               loopback           carrier     unmanaged\n  2 eth0             ether              routable    configured\nIn the results of the command, you can see the name of an Ethernet link, eth0.\nTo create a network configuration file that systemd-networkd uses to establish a static IP address for the eth0 network interface, execute the following command as root: \ncat > /etc/systemd/network/10-static-en.network Change the new file's mode bits by running the chmod command:\nchmod 644 10-static-en.network\nApply the configuration by running the following command:\nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nFor more information, see the man page for systemd-networkd: man systemd.network\nTurning Off DHCP\nBy default, when Photon OS first starts, it creates a DHCP network configuration file, or rule, which appears in /etc/systemd/network, the highest priority directory for network configuration files with the lowest priority filename:\n    cat /etc/systemd/network/99-dhcp-en.network\n    [Match]\n    Name=e*\n[Network]\nDHCP=yes\nTo turn off DHCP for all Ethernet interfaces, change the value of DHCP from yes to no, save the changes, and then restart the systemd-networkd service: \nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nIf you create a configuration file with a higher priority filename (e.g. 10-static-en.network), it is not necessary but still recommended to turn off DHCP.\nAdding a DNS Server\nPhoton OS resolves domain names, IP addresses, and network names for local applications by using systemd-resolved. The systemd-resolved daemon automatically creates and maintains the /etc/resolv.conf file, into which systemd-resolved places the IP address of the DNS server. You should therefore never modify the /etc/resolv.conf file.\n(If you want to implement a local resolver like bind instead of systemd-resolved, stop the systemd-resolved service and disable it.)\nIf you open the default /etc/resolv.conf file after you deploy Photon OS, it looks like this: \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# cat /etc/resolv.conf\n# This file is managed by systemd-resolved(8). Do not edit.\n#\n# Third party programs must not access this file directly, but\n# only through the symlink at /etc/resolv.conf. To manage\n# resolv.conf(5) in a different way, replace the symlink by a\n# static file or a different symlink.\n\nnameserver 198.51.100.2\nTo add a DNS server to your static network configuration file, insert a DNS key into the Network section of, in this example, /etc/systemd/network/10-eth0-static.network and set it to the IP address of your DNS server: \n[Match]\nName=e*\n\n[Network]\nAddress=198.51.0.2/24\nGateway=198.51.0.1\nDNS=198.51.0.1\nAnother way of adding a DNS server is to modify /etc/systemd/resolved.conf--a method that can be particularly useful when your machine is working with DHCP. For more information, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/resolved.conf.html.\nYou can optionally activate the local DNS stub resolver of systemd-resolved by adding dns and resolve to /etc/nsswitch.conf. To do so, make a backup copy of /etc/nsswitch.conf and then execute the following command as root:\nsed -i 's/^hosts.*$/hosts: files resolve dns/' /etc/nsswitch.conf\nFor more information on the systemd-resolved service, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html.\nSetting Up Networking for Multiple NICs\nIf your machine contains multiple NICs, you should, as a best practice, create a .network configuration file for each network interface. The following scenario demonstrates how to set one wired network interface to use a static IP address and another wired network interface to use a dynamic IP address obtained through DHCP. Keep in mind that the following configurations are examples: You must change the IP addresses and other information to match your network and requirements.  \nFirst, create the .network file for the static Ethernet connection in /etc/systemd/network. A best practice is to match the exact name of the network interface, which is in this example eth0. This example file also includes a DNS server for the static IP address. As a result, the configuration sets the UseDNS key to false in the DHCP column so that Photon OS ignores the DHCP server for DNS for this interface.  \ncat > /etc/systemd/network/10-eth0-static-en.network Second, create the .network file for the second network interface, which is named eth1 in this example. This configuration file sets the eth1 interface to an IP address from DHCP and sets DHCP as the source for DNS lookups. Setting the DHCP key to yes acquires an IP address for IPv4 and IPv6. To acquire an IP address for IPv4 only, set the DHCP key to ipv4.\ncat > /etc/systemd/network/50-eth1-dhcp-en.network Combining DHCP and Static IP Addresses with IPv4 and IPv6\nThis section presents examples that demonstrate how to combine DHCP and static IP addresses with both IPv4 and IPv6. \nHere's how to use DHCP to allocate both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:\n[Network]\nDHCP=yes\nHere's how to use DHCP to allocate only IPv4 addresses:\n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv4\nHere's how to use DHCP to allocate only IPv6 addresses:\n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv6\nHere's how to use DHCP for IPv4 addresses and static IP addresses for IPv6 addresses: \n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv4\nAddress=fd00::1/48\nGateway=fd00::252\nHere's how to use DHCP for IPv6 addresses and static IP addresses for IPv4: \n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv6\nAddress=10.10.10.1/24\nGateway=10.10.10.253\nHere's how to use static IP addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6: \n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv6\nAddress=10.10.10.1/24\nGateway=10.10.10.253\nAddress=fd00::1/48\nGateway=fd00::252\nClearing the Machine ID of a Cloned Instance for DHCP\nPhoton OS uses the contents of /etc/machine-id to determine the DHCP unique identifier (duid) that is used for DHCP requests. If you use a Photon OS instance as the base system for cloning to create additional Photon OS instances, you should clear the machine-id with this command: \necho -n > /etc/machine-id\nWith the value cleared, systemd regenerates the machine-id and, as a result, all DHCP requests will contain a unique duid. \nUsing Predictable Network Interface Names\nOn a virtual machine running Photon OS, just as on a bare-metal machine, the Ethernet network interface name might shift from one device to another if you add or removed a card and reboot the machine. A device named eth2, for example, might become eth1 after a NIC is removed and the machine is restarted.\nYou can prevent interface names from reordering by turning on predictable network interface names. The naming schemes that Photon OS uses can then assign fixed, predictable names to network interfaces even after cards or other firmware are added or removed and the system is restarted. With predictable network interface names enabled, you can select among several options to assign persistent names to network interfaces:\n\nApply the slot name policy to set the name of networking devices in the ens format with a statically assigned PCI slot number.\nApply the mac name policy to set the name of networking devices in the enx format a unique MAC address. \nApply the path name policy to set the name of networking devices in the enpXsY format derived from a device connector's physical location.\n\n(Although Photon OS also supports the onboard name policy to set in the eno format the name of networking devices from index numbers given by the firmware, the onboard policy might result in nonpersistent names.) \nThe option that you choose depends on your use case and your unique networking requirements. If, for instance, you clone clones virtual machines in a use case that requires the MAC addresses to be different from one another but the interface name to be the same, you should consider using ens to keep the slot the same after reboots. \nAlternatively, if the cloning function supports it and it works for your use case, you can use enx to set a MAC address, which also persists after reboots. \nHere's how to turn on predictable network interface names.\nFirst, make a backup copy of the following file in case you need to restore it later: \ncp /boot/grub/grub.cfg /boot/grub/grub.cfg.original\nSecond, to turn on predictable network interface names, edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg to remove the following string: \nnet.ifnames=0\nThe string appears near the bottom of the file in the menuentry section:\nmenuentry \"Photon\" {\n    linux \"/boot/\"$photon_linux root=$rootpartition net.ifnames=0 $photon_cmdline\n    if [ \"$photon_initrd\" ]; then\n        initrd \"/boot/\"$photon_initrd\n    fi\n}\n# End /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nEdit out net.ifnames=0, but make no other changes to the file, and then save it. \nThird, specify the types of policies that you want to use for predictable interface names by modifying the NamePolicy option in /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link. Here's what the file looks like: \ncat /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n[Link]\nNamePolicy=kernel database\nMACAddressPolicy=persistent\nTo use the ens or enx option, the slot policy or the mac policy can be added to the space-separated list of policies that follow the NamePolicy option in the default link file, /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link. The order of the policies matters: Photon OS applies the policy listed first before proceeding to the next policy if the first one fails. Example: \n/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n[Link]\nNamePolicy=slot mac kernel database\nMACAddressPolicy=persistent\nWith the name policy specified in the above example, it's possible that you could still end up with an Ethernet-style interface name if the two previous policies, slot and mac, fail. \nFor information on setting name policies, see systemd.link--network device configuration. \nInspecting the Status of Network Links with networkctl\nThe networkctl command shows information about network connections that helps you configure networking services and troubleshoot networking problems. You can, for example, progressively add options and arguments to the networkctl command to move from general information about network connections to specific information about a network connection. \nRunning networkctl without options defaults to the list command:  \nnetworkctl\nIDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP\n  1 lo               loopback           carrier     unmanaged\n  2 eth0             ether              routable    configured\n  3 docker0          ether              routable    unmanaged\n 11 vethb0aa7a6      ether              degraded    unmanaged\n 4 links listed.\nRunning networkctl with the status command displays information that looks like this; you can see that there are active network links with IP addresses for not only the Ethernet connection but also a Docker container. \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# networkctl status\n*      State: routable\n     Address: 198.51.100.131 on eth0\n              172.17.0.1 on docker0\n              fe80::20c:29ff:fe55:3ca6 on eth0\n              fe80::42:f0ff:fef7:bd81 on docker0\n              fe80::4c84:caff:fe76:a23f on vethb0aa7a6\n     Gateway: 198.51.100.2 on eth0\n         DNS: 198.51.100.2\nYou can then add a network link, such as the Ethernet connection, as the argument of the status command to show specific information about the link: \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# networkctl status eth0\n* 2: eth0\n       Link File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n    Network File: /etc/systemd/network/99-dhcp-en.network\n            Type: ether\n           State: routable (configured)\n            Path: pci-0000:02:01.0\n          Driver: e1000\n      HW Address: 00:0c:29:55:3c:a6 (VMware, Inc.)\n             MTU: 1500\n         Address: 198.51.100.131\n                  fe80::20c:29ff:fe55:3ca6\n         Gateway: 198.51.100.2\n             DNS: 198.51.100.2\n        CLIENTID: ffb6220feb00020000ab116724f520a0a77337\nAnd you can do the same thing with the Docker container: \nnetworkctl status docker0\n* 3: docker0\n       Link File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n    Network File: n/a\n            Type: ether\n           State: routable (unmanaged)\n          Driver: bridge\n      HW Address: 02:42:f0:f7:bd:81\n             MTU: 1500\n         Address: 172.17.0.1\n                  fe80::42:f0ff:fef7:bd81\nIn the example above, it is OK that the state of the Docker container is unmanaged; Docker handles managing the networking for the containers without using systemd-resolved or systemd-networkd. Instead, Docker manages the container's connection by using its bridge drive.\nFor more information about networkctl commands and options, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/networkctl.html.\nTurning on Network Debugging\nYou can set systemd-networkd to work in debug mode so that you can analyze log files with debugging information to help troubleshoot networking problems. The following procedure turns on network debugging by adding a drop-in file in /etc/systemd to customize the default systemd configuration in /usr/lib/systemd. \nFirst, run the following command as root to create a directory with this exact name, including the .d extension:\nmkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/\nSecond, run the following command as root to establish a systemd drop-in unit with a debugging configuration for the network service:\ncat > /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-loglevel-debug.conf You must reload the systemctl daemon and restart the systemd-networkd service for the changes to take effect: \nsystemctl daemon-reload\nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nVerify that your changes took effect:\nsystemd-delta --type=extended\nView the log files by running this command: \njournalctl -u systemd-networkd\nWhen you are finished debugging the network connections, turn debugging off by deleting the drop-in file: \nrm /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-loglevel-debug.conf\nMounting a Network File System\nTo mount a network file system, Photon OS requires nfs-utils. The nfs-utils package contains the daemon, userspace server, and client tools for the kernel Network File System, or NFS. The tools include mount.nfs, umount.nfs, and showmount. \nThe nfs-utils package is installed by default in the full version of Photon OS but not in the minimal version. To install nfs-utils in the minimal version, run the following command as root: \ntdnf install nfs-utils\nFor instructions on how to use nfs-utils to share files over a network, see Photon OS nfs-utils.\nInstalling the Packages for tcpdump and netcat with tdnf\nThe minimal version of Photon OS leaves out several useful networking tools to keep the operating system lean. Tcpdump, for example, is absent in the minimal version but available in the repository. The minimal version does, however, include the iproute2 tools by default. \nTcpdump captures and analyzes packets on a network interface. On Photon OS, you install tcpdump and its accompanying package libpcap, a C/C++ library for capturing network traffic, by using tdnf, Photon's command-line package manager: \ntdnf install tcpdump\nNetcat, a tool for sending data over network connections with TCP or UDP, appears in neither the minimal nor the full version of Photon OS. But since netcat furnishes powerful options for analyzing, troubleshooting, and debugging network connections, you might want to install it. To do so, run the following command: \ntdnf install netcat\nCloud-Init on Photon OS\nThe minimal and full versions of Photon OS include the cloud-init service as a built-in component. Cloud-init is a set of Python scripts that initialize cloud instances of Linux machines. The cloud-init scripts configure SSH keys and run commands to customize the machine without user interaction. The commands can set the root password, create a hostname, configure networking, write files to disk, upgrade packages, run custom scripts, and restart the system. \nThere are several ways in which you can deploy Photon OS with cloud-init, including the following: \n\nAs a stand-alone Photon machine\nIn Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, called EC2\nIn the Google cloud through the Google Compute Engine, or GCE\nIn a VMware Vsphere private cloud \n\nWhen a cloud instance of Photon OS starts, cloud-init requires a data source. The data source can be an EC2 file for Amazon's cloud platform, a seed.iso for a stand-alone instance of Photon OS, or the internal capabilities of a system for managing virtual machines, such as VMware vSphere or vCenter. Cloud-init also includes data sources for OpenStack, Apache CloudStack, and OVF. The data source comprises two parts: \n\nMetadata\nUser data\n\nThe metadata gives the cloud service provider instructions on how to implement the Photon OS machine in the cloud infrastructure. Metadata typically includes the instance ID and the local host name. \nThe user data contains the commands and scripts that Photon OS executes when it starts in the cloud. The user data commonly takes the form of a shell script or a YAML file containing a cloud configuration. The cloud-init documentation contains information about the types of data sources and the formats for metadata and user data. \nOn Photon OS, cloud-init is enabled and running by default. You can check its status like this: \nsystemctl status cloud-init \nThe Photon OS directory that contains the local data and other resources for cloud-init is here: \n/var/lib/cloud\nPhoton OS stores the logs for cloud-init in the following file:\n/var/log/cloud-init.log\nThe following sections demonstrate how to use cloud-init to customize a stand-alone Photon OS machine, instantiate a Photon OS machine in the Amazon EC2 cloud, and deploy a virtual machine running Photon OS in vSphere. Each section uses a different combination of the available options for the metadata and the user data that make up the data source. Specifications, additional options, and examples appear in the cloud-init documentation. \nCreating a Stand-Alone Photon Machine with cloud-init\nCloud-init can customize a Photon OS virtual machine by using the nocloud data source. The nocloud data source bundles the cloud-init metadata and user data into a ISO that acts as a seed when you boot the machine. This seed.iso delivers the metadata and the user data without requiring a network connection. \nHere's how customize a Photon OS VM with a nocloud data source:\nFirst, create the metadata file with the following lines in the YAML format and name it meta-data:\ninstance-id: iid-local01\nlocal-hostname: cloudimg\nSecond, create the user data file with the following lines in YAML and name it user-data:\n#cloud-config\nhostname: testhost\npackages:\n - vim\nThird, generate the ISO that will serve as the seed; the ISO must have the volume ID set to cidata. In this example, the ISO is generated on an Ubuntu 14.04 computer containing the files named meta-data and user-data in the local directory: \ngenisoimage -output seed.iso -volid cidata -joliet -rock user-data meta-data\nThe ISO now appears in the current directory: \nsteve@ubuntu:~$ ls\nmeta-data seed.iso user-data\nOptionally, you can check the ISO that you generated on Ubuntu by transferring the ISO to the root directory of your Photon OS machine and then running the following command: \ncloud-init --file seed.iso --debug init\nAfter running the cloud-init command above, check the cloud-init log file: \nmore /var/log/cloud-init.log\nFinally, attach the ISO to the Photon OS virtual machine as a CD-ROM and reboot it so that the changes specified by seed.iso take effect. In this case, cloud-init sets the hostname and adds the vim package.\nCustomizing a Photon OS Machine on EC2\nThis section illustrates how to upload an ami image of Photon OS to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and customize the Photon OS machine by using cloud-init with an EC2 data source. The Amazon machine image version of Photon OS is available as a free download on Bintray:\nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/\nThe cloud-init service is commonly used on EC2 to configure the cloud instance of a Linux image. On EC2, for example, cloud-init typically sets the .ssh/authorized_keys file to let you log in with a private key from another computer--that is, a computer besides the workstation that you are already using to connect with the Amazon cloud. The cloud-config user-data file that appears in the following example contains abridged SSH authorized keys to show you how to set them. \nWorking with EC2 requires Amazon accounts for both AWS and EC2 with valid payment information. If you execute the following examples, you will be charged by Amazon. You will need to replace the  for access keys and other account information in the examples with your account information. \nThe following code assumes you have installed and set up the Amazon AWS CLI and the EC2 CLI tools, including ec2-ami-tools. See Installing the AWS Command Line Interface and Setting Up the Amazon EC2 Command Line Interface Tools on Linux. Also see Setting Up the AMI Tools. \nEC2 requires an SSH key and an RSA certificate. The code in the examples  assumes that you have created SSH keys as well as an RSA user signing certificate and its corresponding private RSA key file.  \nHere's a code example that shows how to upload the Photon OS .ami image to the Amazon cloud and configure it with cloud-init. The correct virtualization type for Photon OS is hvm.   \n$ mkdir bundled\n$ tar -zxvf ./photon-ami.tar.gz \n$ ec2-bundle-image -c ec2-certificate.pem -k ec2-privatekey.pem -u   --arch x86_64 --image photon-ami.raw --destination ./bundled/\n$ aws s3 mb s3://\n$ ec2-upload-bundle --manifest ./bundled/photon-ami.manifest.xml --bucket  --access-key  --secret-key \n$ ec2-register /photon-ami.manifest.xml --name photon-ami --architecture x86_64 --virtualization-type hvm\nIn the following command, the --user-data-file option instructs cloud-init to import the cloud-config data in user-data.txt. The next command assumes you have created the keypair called mykeypair and the security group photon-sg as well as uploaded the user-data.txt file; see the EC2 documentation.\n$ ec2-run-instances  --instance-type m3.medium -g photon-sg --key mykeypair --user-data-file user-data.txt\nYou can now describe the instance to see its ID: \n$ ec2-describe-instances\nAnd you can run the following command to obtain its public IP address, which you can use to connect to the instance with SSH:\n$ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids  --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PublicIpAddress' --output=text\n$ ec2-describe-images\nImportant: When you are done, run the following commands to terminate the machine. Because Amazon charges you while the host is running, make sure to shut it down:  \n$ ec2-deregister \n$ ec2-terminate-instances \nHere are the contents of the user-data.txt file that cloud-init applies to the machine the first time that it boots up in the cloud: \n#cloud-config\nhostname: photon-on-01\ngroups:\n- cloud-admins\n- cloud-users\nusers:\n- default\n- name: photonadmin\n   gecos: photon test admin user\n   primary-group: cloud-admins\n   groups: cloud-users\n   lock-passwd: false\n   passwd: vmware\n- name: photonuser\n   gecos: photon test user\n   primary-group: cloud-users\n   groups: users\n   passwd: vmware\npackages:\n- vim\nssh_authorized_keys:\n - ssh-rsa MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAuvHKAjBhpwuomcUTpIzJWRJAe71JyBgAWrwqyN1Mk5N+c9X5\nRu2fazFA7WxQSD1KyTEvcuf8JzdBfrEJ0v3/nT2x63pvJ8fCl6HRkZtHo8zRu8vY\nKYTZS/sdvM/ruubHfq1ldRpgtYSqbkykoe6PCQIDAQABAoIBAEgveQtjVzHDhLTr\nrmwJmO316ERfkQ/chLaElhi9qwYJG/jqlNIISWFyztqD1b3fxU6m5MOBIujh7Xpg\n... ec3test@example.com\nNow check the cloud-init output log file on EC2 at /var/log/cloud-init-output.log. \nFor more information on using cloud-init user data on EC2, see Running Commands on Your Linux Instance at Launch.\nAn article on the Photon OS GitHub wiki demonstrates how to get Photon OS up and running on EC2 and run a containerized application in the Docker engine. See Running Photon OS on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute.\nWith Photon OS, you can also build cloud images on Google Compute Engine and other cloud providers; see Compatible Cloud Images.\nRunning a Photon OS Machine on GCE\nPhoton OS comes in a preconfigured image ready for Google Cloud Engine. This section demonstrates how to create a Photon OS instance on Google Cloud Engine with and without cloud-init user data.\nThis section assumes that you have set up a GCE account and, if you try the examples, are ready to pay Google for its cloud services. The GCE-ready version of Photon OS, however, comes for free. It is, in the parlance of Google cloud services, a private image. You can freely download it without registration from Bintray: \nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/gce/view\nThe GCE-ready image of Photon OS contains packages and scripts that prepare it for the Google cloud to save you time as you implement a compute cluster or develop cloud applications. The GCE-ready version of Photon OS adds the following packages to the packages installed with the minimal version: \nsudo, tar, which, google-daemon, google-startup-scripts, \nkubernetes, perl-DBD-SQLite, perl-DBIx-Simple, perl, ntp\nIn addition to a GCE account, the following examples require the gcloud command-line tool; see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute.\nHere are the commands to create an instance of Photon OS from the Photon GCE image without using cloud-init. In the following commands, you must replace  with the name of your bucket. You also need to replace the path to the Photon GCE tar file. \n$ gcloud compute instances list\n$ gcloud compute images list\n$ gcloud config list\n$ gsutil mb gs://\n$ gsutil cp  gs:///photon-gce.tar.gz\n$ gcloud compute images create photon-gce-image --source-uri gs:///photon-gce.tar.gz \n$ gcloud compute instances create photon-gce-vm --machine-type \"n1-standard-1\" --image photon-gce-image\n$ gcloud compute instances describe photon-gce-vm\nNow, to create a new instance of a Photon OS machine and configure it with a cloud-init user data file, replace the gcloud compute instances create command in the example above with the following command. Before running this command, you must upload your user-data file to Google's cloud infrastructure and replace  with its path and file name. \ngcloud compute instances create photon-gce-vm --machine-type \"n1-standard-1\" --image photon-gce-vm --metadata-from-file=user-data=\nYou can also add a cloud-init user-data file to an existing instance of a Photon OS machine on GCE: \ngcloud compute instances add-metadata photon-gce-vm --metadata-from-file=user-data=\nDocker Containers\nPhoton OS includes the open source version of Docker. With Docker, Photon OS becomes a Linux run-time host for containers--that is, a Linux cloud container. A container is a process that runs on the Photon OS host with its own isolated application, file system, and networking.\nOn Photon OS, the Docker daemon is enabled by default. To view the status of the daemon, run this command: \nsystemctl status docker\nDocker is loaded and running by default on the full version of Photon OS. On the minimal version, it is loaded but not running by default, so you have to start it: \nsystemctl start docker\nTo obtain information about Docker, run this command as root: \ndocker info\nAfter you make sure that docker is enabled and started, you can, for example, run the following docker command as root to create a container running Ubuntu 14.04 with an interactive terminal shell: \ndocker run -i -t ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash\nPhoton OS also enables you to run a docker container that, in turn, runs Photon OS: \ndocker run -i -t photon /bin/bash\nKubernetes\nThe full version of Photon OS includes Kubernetes so you can manage clusters of containers. For more information, see Running Kubernetes on Photon OS.\nInstalling Sendmail\nBefore you install Sendmail, you should set the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Photon OS machine.\nNeither the full nor the minimal version of Photon OS installs Sendmail by default. When you install Sendmail, it provides Photon OS with a systemd service file that typically enables Sendmail. If, however, the service is not enabled after installation, you must enable it. \nSendmail resides in the Photon extras repository. You can install it with tdnf after setting the machine's FQDN. Here's how: \nFirst, check whether the machine's FQDN is set by running the hostnamectl status command:  \n     hostnamectl status\n   Static hostname: photon-d9ee400e194e\n         Icon name: computer-vm\n           Chassis: vm\n        Machine ID: a53b414142f944319bd0c8df6d811f36\n           Boot ID: 1f75baca8cc249f79c3794978bd82977\n    Virtualization: vmware\n  Operating System: VMware Photon/Linux\n            Kernel: Linux 4.4.8\n      Architecture: x86-64\nIn the results above, the FQDN is not set; the Photon OS machine has only a short name. If the FQDN were set, the hostname would be in its full form, typically with a domain name. \nIf the machine does not have an FQDN, set one by running hostnamectl set-hostname new-name, replacing new-name with the FQDN that you want. Example:  \n hostnamectl set-hostname photon-d9ee400e194e.corp.example.com\nThe hostnamectl status command now shows that the machine has an FQDN: \nroot@photon-d9ee400e194e [ ~ ]# hostnamectl status\n   Static hostname: photon-d9ee400e194e.corp.example.com\n         Icon name: computer-vm\n           Chassis: vm\n        Machine ID: a53b414142f944319bd0c8df6d811f36\n           Boot ID: 1f75baca8cc249f79c3794978bd82977\n    Virtualization: vmware\n  Operating System: VMware Photon/Linux\n            Kernel: Linux 4.4.8\n      Architecture: x86-64\nNext, install Sendmail: \ntdnf install sendmail\nMake sure it is enabled: \nsystemctl status sendmail\nEnable Sendmail if it's disabled and then start it: \nsystemctl enable sendmail\nsystemctl start sendmail\nFixing Sendmail If Installed Before an FQDN Was Set\nIf Sendmail is behaving improperly or if it hangs during installation, it is likely that an FQDN is not set. Take the following corrective action. \nFirst, set an FQDN for your Photon OS machine. \nThen, run the following commands in the order below: \necho $(hostname -f) > /etc/mail/local-host-names\n\ncat > /etc/mail/aliases  sendmail.cf\n\nchmod 700 /var/spool/clientmqueue\n\nchown smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/clientmqueue\nChanging the Locale\nYou can change the locale if the default locale, shown below by running the localectl command, fails to fulfill your requirements: \nlocalectl\nSystem Locale: LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n   VC Keymap: n/a\n  X11 Layout: n/a\nTo change the locale, choose the languages that you want from /usr/share/locale/locale.alias, add them to /etc/locale-gen.conf, and then regenerate the locale list by running the following command as root: \nlocale-gen.sh\nFinally, run the following command to set the new locale, replacing the example (en_US.UTF-8) with the locale that you want: \nlocalectl set-locale LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\" LC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nThe Default Security Policy of Photon OS\nDefault Firewall Settings\nThe design of Photon OS emphasizes security. On the minimal and full versions of Photon OS, the default security policy turns on the firewall and drops packets from external interfaces and  applications. As a result, you might need to add rules to iptables to permit forwarding, allow protocols like HTTP, and open ports. In other words, you must configure the firewall for your applications and requirements. \nThe default iptables settings on the full version look like this:\niptables --list\nChain INPUT (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED\nACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:ssh\n\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nChain OUTPUT (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nTo find out how to adjust the settings, see the man page for iptables. \nAlthough the default iptables policy accepts SSH connections, the sshd configuration file on the full version of Photon OS is set to reject SSH connections. See Permitting Root Login with SSH.\nIf you are unable to ping a Photon OS machine, one of the first things you should do is check the firewall rules. Do they allow connectivity for the port and protocol in question? You can supplement the iptables commands by using lsof commands to, for instance, see the processes listening on ports: \nlsof -i -P -n\nDefault Permissions and umask\nThe umask on Photon OS is set to 0027.\nWhen you create a new file with the touch command as root, the default on Photon OS is to set the permissions to 0640--which translates to read-write for user, read for group, and no access for others. Here's an example: \ntouch newfile.md\nstat newfile.md\n  File: 'newfile.md'\n  Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file\nDevice: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316454      Links: 1\nAccess: (0640/-rw-r-----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nWhen you create a directory as root, Photon OS sets the permissions to 0750:\nmkdir newdir\nstat newdir\n  File: 'newdir'\n  Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory\nDevice: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316455      Links: 2\nAccess: (0750/drwxr-x---)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nBecause the mkdir command uses the umask to modify the permissions placed on newly created files or directories, you can see umask at work in the permissions of the new directory: Its default permissions are set at 0750 after the umask subtracts 0027 from the full set of open permissions, 0777.\nSimilarly, a new file begins as 0666, which you could see if you were to set umask to 0000. But because umask is set by default to 0027, a new file's permissions are set to 0640. \nSo be aware of the default permissions on the directories and files that you create. Some system services and applications might require permissions other than the default. The systemd network service, for example, requires user-defined configuration files to be set to 644, not the default of 640. Thus, after you create a network configuration file with a .network extension, you must run the chmod command to set the new file's mode bits to 644. Example: \nchmod 644 10-static-en.network \nFor more information on permissions, see the man pages for stat, umask, and acl.\nDisabling TLS 1.0 to Improve Transport Layer Security\nPhoton OS includes GnuTLS to help secure the transport layer. GnuTLS is a library that implements the SSL and TLS protocols to secure communications. \nOn Photon OS, SSL 3.0, which contains a known vulnerability, is disabled by default. \nHowever, TLS 1.0, which also contains known vulnerabilities, is enabled by default.\nTo turn off TLS 1.0, make a directory named /etc/gnutls and then in /etc/gnutls create a file named default-priorities. In the default-priorities file, specify GnuTLS priority strings that remove TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 but retain TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2.\nAfter adding a new default-priorities file or after modifying it, you must restart all applications, including SSH, with an open TLS session for the changes to take effect.  \nHere is an example of a default-priorities file that contains GnuTLS priorities to disable TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0:  \ncat /etc/gnutls/default-priorities\nSYSTEM=NONE:!VERS-SSL3.0:!VERS-TLS1.0:+VERS-TLS1.1:+VERS-TLS1.2:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL\nThis example priority string imposes system-specific policies. The NONE keyword means that no algorithms, protocols, or compression methods are enabled, so that you can enable specific versions individually later in the string. The example priority string then specifies that SSL version 3.0 and TLS version 1.0 be removed, as marked by the exclamation point. The priority string then enables, as marked by the plus sign, versions 1.1 and 1.2 of TLS. The cypher is AES-128-CBC. The key exchange is RSA. The MAC is SHA1. And the compression algorithm is COMP-NULL.\nOn Photon OS, you can verify the system-specific policies in the default-priorities file as follows. \nConcatenate the default-priorities file to check its contents: \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# cat /etc/gnutls/default-priorities\nSYSTEM=NONE:!VERS-SSL3.0:!VERS-TLS1.0:+VERS-TLS1.1:+VERS-TLS1.2:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL\nRun the following command to check the protocols that are enabled for the system: \nroot@photon-rc [ /etc/gnutls ]# gnutls-cli --priority @SYSTEM -l\nCipher suites for @SYSTEM\nTLS_RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA1                                0x00, 0x2f      SSL3.0\n\nCertificate types: none\nProtocols: VERS-TLS1.1, VERS-TLS1.2\nCompression: COMP-NULL\nElliptic curves: none\nPK-signatures: none\nFor information about the GnuTLS priority strings, see https://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html.\nFor information about the vulnerability in SSL 3.0, see SSL 3.0 Protocol Vulnerability and POODLE Attack.\nFor information about the vulnerabilities in TLS 1.0, see Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations.\nWorking with Repositories and Packages\nThe design of Photon OS simplifies life-cycle management and improves the security of packages. Photon OS seeks to reduce the burden and complexity of managing clusters of Linux machines by providing curated package repositories and by securing packages with GPG signatures. \nPhoton OS Package Repositories\nThe default installation of Photon OS includes four yum-compatible repositories plus the repository on the Photon OS ISO when it's available in a CD-ROM drive:  \nls /etc/yum.repos.d/\nlightwave.repo\nphoton-extras.repo\nphoton-iso.repo\nphoton-updates.repo\nphoton.repo \nThe Photon ISO repository (photon-iso.repo) contains the installation packages for Photon OS. All the packages that Photon builds and publishes reside in the RPMs directory of the ISO when it is mounted. The RPMs directory contains metadata that lets it act as a yum repository. Mounting the ISO gives you all the packages corresponding to a Photon OS build. If, however, you built Photon OS yourself from the source code, the packages correspond only to your build, though they will typically be the latest. In contrast, the ISO that you obtain from the Bintray web site contains only the packages that are in the ISO at the point of publication. As a result, the packages may no longer match those on Bintray, which are updated regularly.  \nThe main Photon OS repository (photon.repo) contains all the packages that are built from the ISO or from another source. This repository points to a static batch of packages and spec files at the point of a release. \nThe updates repository (photon-updates.repo) is irrelevant to a major release until after the release is installed. Thereafter, the updates repository holds the updated packages for that release. The repository, that is, points to updates for the installed version, such as a version of Kubernetes that supersedes the version installed during the major release. \nThe Photon extras repository (photon-extras.repo) holds Likewise Open, an open source authentication engine, and other VMware software that you can add to Photon OS for free. Photon OS supports but does not build the packages in the extras repository.Similarly, the Lightwave repository (lightwave.repo) contains the packages that make up the VMware Lightwave security suite for cloud applications, including tools for identity management, access control, and certificate management.\nExamining Signed Packages\nPhoton OS signs its packages and repositories with GPG signatures to bolster security. The GPG signature uses keyed-hash authentication method codes, typically the SHA1 algorithm and an MD5 checksum, to simultaneously verify the integrity and authentication of a package. A keyed-hash message authentication code combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret cryptographic key.\nIn Photon OS, GPG signature verification automatically takes place when you install or update a package with the default package manager, tdnf. The default setting in the tdnf configuration file for checking the GPG is set to 1, for true:  \ncat /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf\n[main]\ngpgcheck=1\ninstallonly_limit=3\nclean_requirements_on_remove=true\nrepodir=/etc/yum.repos.d\ncachedir=/var/cache/tdnf\nOn Photon OS, you can view the key with which VMware signs packages by running the following command:  \nrpm -qa gpg-pubkey*\nThe command returns the GPG public key:\ngpg-pubkey-66fd4949-4803fe57\nOnce you have the name of the key, you can view information about the key with the rpm -qi command, as the following abridged output demonstrates: \nrpm -qi gpg-pubkey-66fd4949-4803fe57\nName        : gpg-pubkey\nVersion     : 66fd4949\nRelease     : 4803fe57\nArchitecture: (none)\nInstall Date: Thu Jun 16 11:51:39 2016\nGroup       : Public Keys\nSize        : 0\nLicense     : pubkey\nSignature   : (none)\nSource RPM  : (none)\nBuild Date  : Tue Apr 15 01:01:11 2008\nBuild Host  : localhost\nRelocations : (not relocatable)\nPackager    : VMware, Inc. -- Linux Packaging Key -- \nSummary     : gpg(VMware, Inc. -- Linux Packaging Key -- )\nDescription :\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: rpm-4.11.2 (NSS-3)\nmI0ESAP+VwEEAMZylR8dOijUPNn3He3GdgM/kOXEhn3uQl+sRMNJUDm1qebi2D5b ...\nIf you have one of the RPMs from Photon OS on another Linux system, such as Ubuntu, you can check the status of the SHA and MD5 for the package to verify that it has not been tampered with:\nrpm -K /home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm\n/home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm: sha1 md5 OK\nAnd then you can view the SHA1 digest and the MD5 digest by running the following command: \nrpm -Kv /home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm\n/home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm:\nHeader SHA1 digest: OK (89b55443d4c9f67a61ae0c1ec9bf4ece2d6aa32b)\n        MD5 digest: OK (51eee659a8730e25fd2a52aff9a6c2c2)\nThe above examples show that the Kubernetes package has not been tampered with.\nBuilding a Package from a Source RPM\nThis section describes how to install and build a package on the full version of Photon OS from the package's source RPM. You obtain the source RPMs that Photon OS uses from Bintray: \nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon\nTo build a package from its source RPM, or SRPM, Photon OS requires the following packages:  \n\nrpmbuild. This package is installed by default on the full version of Photon OS, so you should not have to install it. \ngcc. This package is also installed by default on the full version of Photon OS, so you should not have to install it. \nmake, Cmake, automake, or another make package, depending on the package you are trying to install and build from its source RPM. Cmake is installed by default on Photon OS. You can install other make packages if need be by using tdnf or yum.  \n\nAnother requirement is a local unprivileged user account other than the root account. You should build RPMs as an unprivileged user. Do not build a package as root--building an RPM with the root account might damage your system. \nIf you are building a package on a virtual machine running Photon OS in VMware vSphere, VMware Workstation, or VMware Fusion, take a snapshot of your virtual machine before building the package. \nVMware recommends that you install and build packages from their source RPMs on the full version of Photon OS. Do not use the minimal version to work with source RPMs.  \nHere's how to install and build an example package--sed, in this case--from its source RPM on Photon OS with an unprivileged account. \nFirst, check whether rpmbuild is installed by running the following command: \nrpmbuild --version\nIf it is not installed, install it by running the following command as root: \ntdnf install rpm-build\nSecond, create the directories for building RPMs under your local user account's home directory (not under root):\nmkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}\nNext, create a .rpmmacros file under your home directory and override the default location of the RPM building tree with the new one. This command overwrites an existing .rpmmacros file. Before running the following command, make sure you do not already have a .rpmmacros file; if a .rpmmacros file exists, back it up under a new name in case you want to restore it later. \necho '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros\nNow place the source RPM file that you want to install and build in the /tmp directory. \nTo install the source file, run the following command with your unprivileged user account, replacing the sed example source RPM with the name of the one that you want to install: \nrpm -i /tmp/sed-4.2.2-2.ph1.src.rpm\nThe above command unpacks the source RPM and places its .spec file in your ~/rpmbuild/SPECS directory. In the next step, the rpmbuild tool uses the .spec file to build the RPM. \nTo build the RPM, run the following commands with your unprivileged user account. Again, replace the sed.spec example file with the name of the .spec file that you want to build. \ncd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS\nrpmbuild -ba sed.spec\nIf successful, the rpmbuild -ba command builds the RPM and generates an RPM package file in your ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64 directory. Example:\nls RPMS/x86_64/\nsed-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm  sed-debuginfo-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm  sed-lang-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm\nThe rpmbuild command also generates a new SRPM file and saves it in your ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS directory. Example:  \nls SRPMS/\nsed-4.2.2-2.src.rpm\nIf the rpmbuild command is unsuccessful with an error that it cannot find a library, you must install the RPMs for the library that your source RPM depends on before you can successfully build your source RPM. Iterate through installing the libraries that your source RPM relies on until you can successfully build it. \nTo install the RPM, run the following command with your unprivileged user account:  \nrpm -i RPMS/x86_64/sed-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm\nCompiling C++ Code on the Minimal Version of Photon OS\nAs a minimalist Linux run-time environment, the minimal version of Photon OS lacks the packages that you need to compile the code for a C++ program. For example, without the requisite packages, trying to compile the file containing the following code with the gcc command will generate errors: \n#include \nint main()\n{\nreturn 0;\n}\nThe errors look something like this: \ngcc test.c\n-bash: gcc: command not found\ntdnf install gcc -y\ngcc test.c\ntest.c:1:19: fatal error: stdio.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.\nTo enable the minimal version of Photon OS to preprocess, compile, assemble, and link C++ code, you must install the following packages as root with tdnf:\n\ngcc\nglibc-devel\nbinutils\n\nHere's the tdnf command to install these packages: \ntdnf install gcc glibc-devel binutils\nReferences\n\nPhoton OS Getting Started Guides\nPhoton OS Troubleshooting Guide\nFAQ\n\n"},"Upgrading-to-Photon-OS-2.0.html":{"url":"Upgrading-to-Photon-OS-2.0.html","title":"Upgrading to Photon OS 2.0","keywords":"","body":"Upgrading to Photon OS 2.0\nYou can upgrade your existing Photon OS 1.0 VMs to take advantage of security and functionality enhancements in Photon OS 2.0.

It provides instructions for downloading Photon OS (as an OVA or ISO file), describes the various installation options, and walks through the steps of installing the Photon OS distribution on vSphere. Once Photon OS is installed, this document highlights how to deploy a containerized application in Docker with a single command.\n\nAbout Photon OS\nDeciding Whether to Use OVA or ISO\nDownloading Photon OS\nImporting the OVA for Photon OS 2.0\nInstalling the ISO Image for Photon OS 2.0\nDeploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS\nInstalling Photon OS v1.0\n\nNote: If you want to upgrade an existing Photon 1.0 VM, refer to the instructions in Upgrading to Photon OS 2.0. \nAbout Photon OS\nPhoton OS™ is an open source Linux container host optimized for cloud-native applications, cloud platforms, and VMware infrastructure. Photon OS provides a secure run-time environment for efficiently running containers. For an overview, see  https://vmware.github.io/photon/.\nRequirements\nUsing Photon OS within VMware vSphere requires the following resources:\n\n\n\nResources\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nVMware vSphere installed\nVMware web client (v6.5) for ESXi hosts (recommended) Note: vSphere 6 and vSphere 5.5 (these clients provide limited support; not all features are available).\n\n\nMemory\nESXi host with 2GB of free RAM (recommended)\n\n\nStorage\nMinimal Photon install : ESXi host with at least 512MB of free space (minimum); Full Photon install : ESXi host with at least 4GB of free space (minimum); 16GB is recommended\n\n\nDistribution File\nPhoton OS ISO or OVA file downloaded from Bintray\n\n\n\nResource requirements and recommendations vary depending on several factors, including the host environment (for example, VMware vSphere and VMware Fusion), the distribution file used (ISO or OVA), and the selected installation settings (for example, full or basic installation).\nNote: The setup instructions in this guide use VMware vSphere 6 and the vSphere web client.\nDeciding Whether to Use OVA or ISO\nThe first step is decide whether to use the OVA or ISO distribution to set up Photon OS.\n\nOVA import : Because of the nature of an OVA, you're getting a pre-installed version of Photon OS. You can choose the hardware version you want (OVA with hardware version 13 or 11). The OVA benefits from a simple import process and some kernel tuning for VMware environments. However, because it's a pre-installed version, the set of packages that are installed are predetermined. Any additional packages that you need can be installed using tdnf.\nISO install : The ISO, on the other hand, allows for a more complete installation or automated installation via kickstart.\n\nIf you're just looking for the fastest way to get up and running, start with the OVA.\nDownloading Photon OS\nOnce you've decided which way to install, you'll need to download the correct binaries. Go to the following Bintray URL and download the latest release of Photon OS:\nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/\nFor instructions, see Downloading Photon OS.\nNote: For ISO installation, you will need to upload to a datashare that is attached to the ESXi host, or mount the file share (where the ISO resides) as a data store.\nImporting the OVA for Photon OS 2.0\nUsing the OVA is a fast and easy way to create a Photon OS VM on VMware vSphere.\nAfter you've downloaded the OVA, log in to your vSphere environment.\nStep 1: Start the Import Process\nFrom the Actions pull-down menu, choose Create/Register VM.\n\nIn the Select creation type window, choose  Deploy a virtual machine from an OVF or OVA file.\n(images/vs-ova-new-vm-ova.png)\nChoose Next.\nStep 2: Select the OVA File\nEnter a name for the virtual machine, and select the OVA file.\n\nChoose Next.\nStep 3: Specify the Target Datastore\nFrom the Select storage screen, select the target datastore for your VM.\n\nChoose  Next.\nStep 4: Accept the License Agreement\nRead through the Photon OS License Agreement, and then choose I Agree.\n\nChoose Next.\nStep 5: Select Deployment Options\nSelect deployment options.\n\nPhoton OS is provisioned with a maximum disk size. By default, Photon OS uses only the portion of disk space that it needs, usually much less that the entire disk size ( Thin client). If you want to pre-allocate the entire disk size (reserving it entirely for Photon OS instead), select Thick  instead.\nChoose Next.\nStep 6: Verify Deployment Settings\nVerify your deployment settings.\n\nClick Finish. vSphere uploads and validates your OVA. Depending on bandwidth, this operation might take a while.\nWhen finished, vShield powers up a new VM based on your selections.\nStep 7: Change Login Settings\n\nAfter the VM is booted, open the command window. vSphere prompts you to log in.\nNote: Because of limitations within OVA support on vSphere, it was necessary to specify a default password for the OVA option. However, all Photon OS instances that are created by importing the OVA will require an immediate password change upon login. The default account credentials are:\n\n\n\nSetting\nValue\n\n\n\n\nUsername\nroot\n\n\nPassword\nchangeme\n\n\n\nAfter you provide these credentials, vSphere prompts you to create a new password and type it a second time to verify it.\nNote: For security, Photon OS forbids common dictionary words for the root password.  \nOnce logged in, you will see the shell prompt.\n\nOnce complete, proceed to Deploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS.\nStep 9: Export the VM as a Template (Optional)\nConsider converting this imported VM into a template (from the Actions menu, choose Export ) so that you have a master Photon OS instance that can be combined with vSphere Guest Customization to enable rapid provisioning of Photon OS instances.\nInstalling the ISO Image for Photon OS 2.0\nAfter you have downloaded the Photon OS ISO image into a folder of your choice, complete the following steps.\nStep 1: Upload the ISO Image\nUpload the ISO image to a datastore that is attached to the host on which you'll create the Photon OS virtual machine.\nStep 2: Create a New VM\nLog in to your vSphere environment. In the Virtual Machines window, choose Create/Register VM.\nOn the Select creation type screen, select Create a new virtual machine.\n\nChoose Next.\nStep 3: Configure VM Settings\nSpecify a VM name.\n\nSpecify a guest operating system.\n\nFor Compatibility, select ESXi 6.5.\nFor Guest OS family, select Linux.\nFor Guest OS version, select VMware Photon OS (64-bit).\n\n\nChoose  Next.\nStep 4: Select the Target Datastore\nSelect the datastore where you want to store the VM.\n\nClick Next.\nStep 5: Customize VM Settings\nCustomize the virtual machine settings.\n\nFor CD/DVD Drive 1, click the drop-down and select Datastore ISO file.\nIn the Datastore browser, select the ISO that you want to import.\nChange other settings as applicable.\n\nThe recommended virtual hardware settings for your Photon VM are heavily dependent upon the container load you intend to run within Photon OS – more containers or more intensive containers will require you to adjust these settings for your application load. VMware suggests 2 vCPU, 1024MB memory, 20GB hard disk. Any unwanted devices should be removed. Be sure to mount the Photon OS ISO on the CD/DVD Drive and put a check in the box next to, Connect At Power On.\nIf you want to configure a secure boot for the Photon OS VM you created, choose the VM Options tab, expand Boot Options, and select EFI from the firmware drop-down.  An EFI boot ensures that the ISO content is signed by VMware and that the entire stack is secure.\n\nChoose Next.\nStep 6: Verify VM Settings\nThe installer displays a summary of your selected settings.\n\nClick Finish. vSphere creates the VM.\nStep 7: Power on the VM\nSelect the VM and power it on.\n\nWhen you see the Photon Installer boot menu, press Enter on your keyboard to start installing.\nStep 8: Accept the License Agreement\nRead the License Agreement and press the Enter key to accept.\n\nStep 9: Configure the Partition\nThe installer will detect one disk, which should be the 16GB volume configured as part of the virtual machine creation. Choose Auto  to have the installer automatically allocate the partition, or choose Custom  if you want to configure individual partitions, and then press the Enter key.\n\nNote:  If you choose Custom, the installer displays the following screen.\n\nFor each custom partition, choose Create New  and specify the following information:\n\nSize - Preallocated size of this partition, in MB.\nType - One of the following options:\n\next3 - ext3 file system\next4 - ext4 file system\nswap - swap partition\n\nMountpoint - Mount point for this partition.\nChoose OK and press the Enter key. When you are done defining custom partitions, choose Next and press the Enter key.\nThe installer prompts you to confirm that you want to erase the entire disk.\n\nChoose Yes and press the Enter key.\nStep 10: Select an Installation Option\nAfter partitioning the disk, the installer will prompt you to select an installation option.\n\nEach install option provides a different run-time environment, depending on your requirements.\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPhoton Minimal\nPhoton Minimum is a very lightweight version of the container host runtime that is best suited for container management and hosting. There is sufficient packaging and functionality to allow most common operations around modifying existing containers, as well as being a highly performant and full-featured runtime.\n\n\nPhoton Full\nPhoton Full includes several additional packages to enhance the authoring and packaging of containerized applications and/or system customization. For simply running containers, Photon Full will be overkill. Use Photon Full for developing and packaging the application that will be run as a container, as well as authoring the container, itself. For testing and validation purposes, Photon Full will include all components necessary to run containers.\n\n\nPhoton OSTree Server\nThis installation profile will create the server instance that will host the filesystem tree and managed definitions for rpm-ostree managed hosts created with the \"Photon OSTree Host\" installation profile. Most environments should need only one Photon OSTree Server instance to manage the state of the Photon OSTree Hosts. Use Photon OSTree Server when you are establishing a new repository and management node for Photon OS hosts.\n\n\n\nNote:  The option you choose determines the disk and memory resources required for your installation.\nSelect the option you want and press the Enter key.\nStep 11: Select the Linux Kernel\nSelect a Linux kernel to install.\n\n\nHypervisor  optimized means that any components that are not needed for running under a VMware hypervisor have been removed for faster boot times.\nGeneric  means that all components are included.\n\nChoose Next and press the Enter key.\nStep 12: Specify the Hostname\nThe installer prompts you for a hostname and suggest a randomly generated, unique hostname that you can change if you want.\n\nPress the Enter key.\nStep 13: Specify the System root Password\nThe installer prompts you to enter the system root password.\nNote: Photon OS will not permit commonly used dictionary words to be set as a root password.\n\nType a password and press the Enter key.\nThe installer prompts you to confirm your root password by typing it a second time.\n\nNote: If you have trouble with unintentional repeated characters in the Remote Console, follow VMware KB 196 ( http://kb.vmware.com/kb/196) for a setting to apply to the virtual machine.\nPress the Enter key. The installer proceeds to install the software. Installation times will vary based on the system hardware and installation options you selected. Most installations complete in less than one minute.\nStep 14: Reboot the VM and Log In\nOnce finished, the installer displays a confirmation message (which includes how long it took to install Photon OS) and prompts you to press a key on your keyboard to boot the new VM.\n\nAs the initial boot process begins, the installer displays the Photon splash screen, and then a login prompt.\n\nAt the login prompt, type root  as the username and provide the password chosen during the installation.\n\nYou have now successfully setup Photon OS and are ready to use your container runtime environment. Proceed to the next section to deploy a containerized application.\nDeploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS\nNow that you have your container runtime environment up and running, you can easily deploy a containerized application. For this example, you will deploy the popular open source Web Server Nginx. The Nginx application has a customized VMware package that is published as a dockerfile and can be downloaded, directly, through the Docker module from the Docker Hub.\nStep 1: Run Docker\nTo run Docker from the command prompt, enter the following command, which initializes the docker engine:\nsystemctl start docker\nTo ensure Docker daemon service runs on every subsequent VM reboot, enter the following command:\nsystemctl enable docker\nStep 2: Run the Nginx Web Server\nNow the Docker daemon service is running, it is a simple task to \"pull\" and start the Nginx Web Server container from Docker Hub. To do this, type the following command:\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\nThis pulls the Nginx Web Server files and appropriate dependent container filesystem layers required for this containerized application to run.\n\nAfter the docker run  process completes, you return to the command prompt. You now have a fully active website up and running in a container!\nStep 3: Test the Web Server\nTo test that your Web Server is active, run the ifconfig command to get the IP address of the Photon OS Virtual Machine.\n\nThe output displays a list of adapters that are connected to the virtual machine. Typically, the web server daemon will be bound on eth0.\nStart a browser on your host machine and enter the IP address of your Photon OS Virtual Machine. You should see a screen similar to the following example as confirmation that your web server is active.\n\nYou can now run any other containerized application from Docker Hub or your own containerized application within Photon OS.\nInstalling Photon OS v1.0\nThis section provides installation instructions for Photon OS v1.0.\nPhoton OS 1.0 Prerequisites\nIn order to install and start using Photon OS with VMware vSphere, the following pre-requisites must be satisfied: \n\nVMware vSphere 5.5 or VMware vSphere 6.0 installed \nESXi host with recommended 2GB of free RAM\nESXi host with recommended 8GB of free disk space\nThe Photon OS ISO downloaded from Bintray\n\nThis document uses VMware vSphere 6. VMware recommends that you use the latest version, though vSphere 5.5 or later should work as well. \nImporting the Photon OS 1.0 OVA\nUsing the OVA is a fast and easy way to create a Photon OS VM. Once you’ve downloaded the OVA, log in to your vSphere environment and, from the Actions pull-down menu, select, Deploy OVF Template … On the popup window, point vSphere to the OVA file that you’ve downloaded. \n\nClick the Next button at the bottom of the window and vSphere will upload and validate your OVA. Depending on bandwidth, this operation might take a while. \nAfter validating the image, vSphere will present a summary of the details of the OVA. Click the Next button to proceed to selecting a location to store the imported Photon OS instance.\nClick Finish\nAt this point, you’ve got a Photon OS instance ready to go; but before you power on that Photon OS instance, consider first converting this VM into a template. By converting this imported VM to a template, you have a master Photon OS instance that can be combined with vSphere Guest Customization to enable rapid provisioning of Photon OS instances. \nThe OVA contains a default password of \"changeme\" for the root account that must be changed upon initial login. For security, Photon OS forbids common dictionary words for the root password.\n \nInstalling the Photon OS 1.0 ISO Image\nOnce the ISO image has been uploaded to a datastore that is attached to the host on which you’ll create the Photon OS virtual machine, start the installation process by creating a new virtual machine.\nWhen creating a new VM, the first thing you’ll need to specify is the compatibility of that VM with ESXi versions. Select a compatibility level for your VM, as shown below. Photon OS shouldn’t require any particular compatibility, but VMware recommends that you choose the latest available option for your release of vSphere.\n\nWhen prompted for the Guest OS Family, choose Linux and, for Guest OS Version, choose Other 3.x Linux (64-bit). \n\nThe recommended virtual hardware settings for your Photon VM are heavily dependent upon the container load you intend to run within Photon OS – more containers or more intensive containers will require you to adjust these settings for your application load. VMware suggests 2 vCPU, 1024MB memory, 20GB hard disk. Any unwanted devices should be removed.  Be sure to mount the Photon OS ISO on the CD/DVD Drive and put a check in the box next to, Connect At Power On.\n\nTo summarize, these are the settings we recommend as a starting point for your Photon OS container runtime host: Thin provisioned, hardware compatibility: ESXi 6.0 and later (VM version 11).\nPower on the Photon OS virtual machine and, within a few seconds, the Photon Installer Boot Menu will appear.  Download and install the Remote Console if you do not have it already; otherwise, click Launch Remote Console to interact with the installer.\n\nOnce connected to the remote console, select Install to proceed.\n\nAfter you accept the EULA, the installer will detect one disk, which should be the 20GB volume configured as part of the virtual machine creation. Select the disk and press enter.  When you are prompted to confirm that it is okay to erase the entire disk, select Yes to accept and proceed with the installation.\n\nYou will now be presented with several installation options:\n\nEach install option provides a different runtime environment:\n\nPhoton Minimal: Photon Minimum is a very lightweight version of the container host runtime that is best suited for container management and hosting. There is sufficient packaging and functionality to allow most common operations around modifying existing containers, as well as being a highly performant and full-featured runtime. \n\nPhoton Full: Photon Full includes several additional packages to enhance the authoring and packaging of containerized applications and system customization. For simply running containers, Photon Full will be overkill. Use Photon Full for developing and packaging the application that will be run as a container, as well as authoring the container itself. For testing and validation purposes, Photon Full will include all components necessary to run containers. \n\nPhoton OSTree Host: This installation profile creates a Photon OS instance that will source its packages from a central rpm-ostree server and continue to have the library and state of packages managed by the definition that is maintained on the central rpm-ostree server. Use Photon OStree Hosts when you are interested in experimenting with the concept of a centrally authored and maintained OS version. This concept of treating the OS as a versioned, atomic entity can simplify lifecycle management and security at scale. \n\nPhoton OSTree Server: This installation profile will create the server instance that will host the filesystem tree and managed definitions for rpm-ostree managed hosts created with the Photon OSTree Host installation profile. Most environments should need only one Photon OSTree Server instance to manage the state of the Photon OSTree Hosts. Use Photon OSTree Server when you are establishing a new repository and management node for Photon OS hosts.  \n\n\nFor the purposes of this how-to guide, select the option to install Photon Minimal. Once Photon Minimal is highlighted, press the Enter key on your keyboard.\nYou will now be prompted for a hostname. Photon OS will prepopulate a randomly generated, unique hostname; you can either use this suggestion or enter your own hostname, as shown in the screenshot below:\n\nAfter selecting a hostname and pressing Enter, you will be prompted to first type and, then, confirm the system root password. If you have trouble with unintentional repeated characters in the Remote Console, follow VMware KB 196 (http://kb.vmware.com/kb/196) for a setting to apply to the virtual machine.\nNote: Photon OS will not permit commonly used dictionary words to be set as a root password.\nAfter confirming the password, the installation process should begin.\nInstallation times will vary based on system hardware and installation options, but most installations complete in less than a minute. Once the installation completes, press any key and the virtual machine will reboot into Photon OS.\nAs the initial boot process begins, you will see the Photon splash screen before you are taken to a login prompt.\nAt the login prompt, enter root as the username and provide the password chosen during the installation. \nYou have now successfully setup Photon OS and are ready to use your container runtime environment.\n \nInstalling a Containerized Application in Photon OS 1.0\nNow that you have your container runtime environment up and running, you may be wondering, “what can I do now?” A command prompt is not the most exciting thing. To help demonstrate the ease with which you can deploy a containerized application, this section showcases how you can quickly get a web server up and running.\nFor this example, we will use the popular open source web server Nginx. The Nginx application has a customized VMware package  published as a dockerfile that can be downloaded directly in Docker from the Docker Hub.\nTo run Docker from the command prompt, enter the command below to initialize the docker engine:\nsystemctl start docker\nTo ensure the docker daemon service runs on every subsequent VM reboot, enter:\nsystemctl enable docker\nNow that the docker daemon service is running, it is a simple task to pull and start the Nginx Web Server container from Docker Hub.  To do this, enter the following command:\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\nThis will then pull the Nginx Web Server files and appropriate dependent containers to ensure this containerized application can run.  You will see a screenshot similar to below, as the container and dependencies are downloaded and the container is prepared to run: \n\nOnce the docker run process is completed, you will be returned to the command prompt.  You now have a fully active web server up and running through typing just a single command within Photon OS using containers.\nTo test that your web server is active, we need to get the IP address of the Photon OS Virtual Machine. To get the IP address, enter the following command: \nifconfig\nThis will now display a list of adapters connected to the virtual machine.  Typically, the web server daemon will be bound to eth0.  \nStart a browser on your host machine and enter the IP address of your Photon OS Virtual Machine.  The following screen will appear showing that your web server is active:\n\nYou can now run any other containerized application from Docker Hub or your own containerized application within Photon OS.\nIf you are having trouble viewing the screen that shows the web server is active, you might have to add an iptables rule to your container VM to allow traffic on Port 80:\niptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\nIn addition, you might have to modify /etc/httpd/httpd.conf to listen on Port 80 by adding the following line:  \nListen 0.0.0.0:80\n"},"Running-Project-Photon-on-Fusion.html":{"url":"Running-Project-Photon-on-Fusion.html","title":"Running Photon OS on Fusion","keywords":"","body":"Running Photon OS on Fusion\nThis guide describes how to get started using Photon OS as a virtual machine within VMware Fusion. It provides instructions for downloading Photon OS (as an OVA or ISO file), describes the various installation options, and walks through the steps of installing the Photon OS distribution on Fusion. Once Photon OS is installed, this document shows how to deploy a containerized application in Docker with a single command.\n\nAbout Photon OS\nRequirements\nDeciding Whether to Use an OVA or ISO\nDownloading Photon OS\nImporting the OVA for Photon OS 2.0\nInstalling the ISO Image for Photon OS 2.0\nDeploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS\nInstalling Photon OS 1.0\n\nNote: If you want to upgrade an existing Photon 1.0 VM, refer to the instructions in Upgrading to Photon OS 2.0. \nAbout Photon OS\nPhoton OS™ is an open source Linux container host optimized for cloud-native applications, cloud platforms, and VMware infrastructure. Photon OS provides a secure run-time environment for efficiently running containers. For an overview, see https://vmware.github.io/photon/.\nRequirements\nUsing Photon OS within VMware Fusion requires the following resources:\n\n\n\nResource\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nVMware Fusion\nVMware Fusion (v7.0 or higher) must be installed. The latest version is recommended.\n\n\nMemory\n2GB of free RAM (recommended)\n\n\nStorage\nMinimal Photon install : 512MB of free space (minimum); Full Photon install : 4GB of free space (minimum); 8GB recommended.\n\n\nDistribution File\nPhoton OS ISO or OVA file downloaded from bintray ( https://bintray.com/vmware/photon/).\n\n\n\nResource requirements and recommendations vary depending on several factors, including the host environment (for example, VMware Fusion and VMware vSphere), the distribution file used (ISO or OVA), and the selected installation settings (for example, full or basic installation).\nNote: The setup instructions in this guide use VMware Fusion Professional version 8.5.8, as per the following screenshot.\n\nDeciding Whether to Use an OVA or ISO\nThe first step is decide whether to use the OVA or ISO distribution to set up Photon OS.\n\nOVA import: Because of the nature of an OVA, you're getting a pre-installed version of Photon OS. Choose the OVA with Hardware Version 11 (not 13). The OVA benefits from a simple import process and some kernel tuning for VMware environments. However, because it's a pre-installed version, the set of packages that are installed are predetermined. Any additional packages that you need can be installed using tdnf.\nISO install: The ISO, on the other hand, allows for a more complete installation or automated installation via kickstart.\n\nIf you're just looking for the fastest way to get up and running, start with the OVA.\nDownloading Photon OS\nOnce you've decided which way to install, you'll need to download the correct binaries. Go to the following Bintray URL and download the latest release of Photon OS:\nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/\nFor instructions, see  Downloading Photon OS.\nImporting the OVA for Photon OS 2.0\nImporting the OVA image is the easiest way to create a Photon OS VM.\nStep 1: Start the Import Process\nAfter you have downloaded the latest Photon OS OVA image (OVA with Hardware Version 11) into a folder of your choice, open VMware Fusion. From the File menu, choose Import …. Fusion prompts you to choose an existing virtual machine.\n\nChoose the Choose File …  button to locate and select the Photon OS OVA, then choose Continue.\n\nStep 2: Specify the Name and Storage Location\nProvide the name and storage location for your Photon OS VM, then choose Save.\n\nReview the Photon OS License Agreement, then choose Accept to start the import process.\n\nStep 3: Configure VM Settings\nAfter the OVA is imported, Fusion displays a confirmation that the import has completed and a summary of the settings for your Photon OS VM. The following screen shot is an example (your settings may vary).\n\nImportant: Choose Customize Settings  to change the operating system (as recognized by the hypervisor) for the newly imported VM.\n\nChoose General.\nClick the selection box next to OS, select Linux , and then select VMware Photon 64-bit.\n\nClose the settings window. Fusion prompts you to verify that you want to change the operating system.\n\nClick Change. Your Photon OS VM is ready to power on.\nStep 4: Power on the VM\nPower on the Photon OS VM. Fusion may ask you whether you want to upgrade this VM.\n\nHow you respond depends on which hardware version (13 or 11) that you want to use. Upgrade if you need to use devices supported only in hardware version 13. Don't upgrade if you want to be compatible with older tools that are supported in hardware version 11.\nStep 5: Update Login Credentials\n\nAfter the VM is booted, Fusion prompts you to log in.\nNote : Because of limitations within OVA support on Fusion, it was necessary to specify a default password for the OVA option. However, all Photon OS instances that are created by importing the OVA will require an immediate password change upon login. The default account credentials are:\n\n\n\nSetting\nValue\n\n\n\n\nUsername\nroot\n\n\nPassword\nchangeme\n\n\n\nAfter you provide these credentials, Fusion prompts you to create a new password and type it a second time to verify it. For security, Photon OS forbids common dictionary words for the root password. Once logged in, you will see the shell prompt.\n\nOnce complete, proceed to Deploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS.\nInstalling the ISO Image for Photon OS 2.0\nAfter you have downloaded the latest Photon OS ISO image into a folder of your choice, open VMware Fusion.\nStep 1: Start the Installation Process\nFrom the File menu, choose  New.\n\nFrom the Select the Installation Method dialog, select Install from disc or image, and then choose Continue.\n\nStep 2: Select the ISO Image\nDrag a disc image onto the window or choose Use another disc or disc image..., choose the ISO file you want, and then choose Continue.\n\nStep 3: Select the Operating System\nOn the Choose Operating System dialog, select Linux  in the left-hand column and VMware Photon 64-bit  in the right-hand column.\n\nChoose Continue.\nStep 4: Select the Virtual Disk (Optional)\nIf you are using a Fusion version that is older than Fusion 8, you might see the following dialog.\n\nIf you see this dialog, unless you're installing into an existing machine, choose Create a new virtual disk  from the Choose a Virtual Disk dialog, and then choose Continue.\nNote: Fusion v8 and later automatically defaults to creating a new 8GB disk and formats it automatically. If you want to use an existing disk, or if you want to pre-allocate all 8GB, go into VM Settings, choose Add Device, and choose either New Hard Disk or Existing Hard Disk. Expand Advanced options  and configure whether you want to pre-allocate disk space (disabled by default) or split into multiple files (enabled by default).\nStep 5: Configure VM Settings\nImportant: Before you finish creating the Photon OS Virtual Machine, we strongly recommend that you customize the virtual machine and remove any unwanted devices that are not needed for a container run-time environment.\n\nTo remove unnecessary devices, choose Customize Settings.\nFirst, choose a name for your Virtual Machine, along with the folder into which you create the Virtual Machine (or accept the default folder).\n\nChoose Save. The virtual machine will be created. The Settings screen allows you to customize virtual hardware for the new virtual machine. If it does not automatically appear, open Settings from the Virtual Machine menu bar.\n\nYou can remove (recommended) the following components that are not used by Photon OS:\n\nSelect Display and ensure that the Accelerate 3D Graphics option is unchecked (it should be unchecked, by default). Select Show All to return to the VM Settings.\nSelect CD/DVD (IDE) and ensure that the Connect CD/DVD Drive box is checked (it should be checked by default). Select Show All to return to the VM Settings.\nSelect Sound Card, un-check the Connect Sound Card Option, and click Remove Sound Card. Choose Remove to confirm your action. Select Show All to return to the VM Settings.\nSelect USB & Bluetooth and uncheck the Share Bluetooth devices with Linux setting. Select Show All to return to the VM Settings.\nSelect Printer and press the Remove Printer Port button in the bottom left hand corner. Choose Remove to confirm your action. Select Show All to return to the VM Settings.\nSelect Camera and press the Remove Camera button in the bottom left hand corner. Choose Remove to confirm your action. Select Show All to return to the VM Settings.\nSelect Advanced and ensure that the Pass Power Status to VM option is unchecked (it should be unchecked, by default). Select Show All, but do not close the VM Settings window.\n\nBy default, Photon OS is configured with a disk size of 8GB. However, Photon OS uses only the portion of disk space it needs, usually much less that the entire disk size. If you want to pre-allocate the entire disk size (reserving it entirely for Photon OS instead), select Hard Disk, expand Advanced options, and check Pre-allocate disk space (by default, it is unchecked). Select Show All to return to the VM Settings.\nStep 6: Configure a Secure Boot (Optional)\nNote:  If you want to configure a secure boot for the Photon OS VM you created, edit its .vmx file  and add the following line:\nfirmware = \"efi\"\nThe EFI boot ensures that the ISO content is signed by VMware and that the entire stack is secure.\nAfter you have made the customizations you want, close the Virtual Machine Settings window. You are now ready to boot and begin the installation process.\nStep 7: Power On the VM\nReturn to the Fusion main menu, select the Photon OS Virtual Machine, and click Start Up (you can also choose Start Up from the Virtual Machine menu).\nFusion powers on the host and starts the installation. Within a few seconds, Fusion displays the Photon OS installer boot menu.\n\nPress the Enter key on your keyboard to start installing.\n\nRead the License Agreement and press the Enter key to accept.\nStep 8: Configure the Partition\nThe Installer will detect one disk, which should be the 8GB volume configured as part of the virtual machine creation.\n\nChoose Auto  to have the installer automatically allocate the partition, or choose Custom if you want to configure individual partitions, and then press the Enter key.\nNote: If you choose Custom, the installer displays the following screen.\n\nFor each custom partition, choose Create New  and specify the following information:\n\nSize - Preallocated size of this partition, in MB.\nType - One of the following options:\n\next3 - ext3 file system\next4 - ext4 file system\nswap - swap partition\n\nMountpoint - Mount point for this partition.\nChoose OK and press the Enter key. When you are done defining custom partitions, choose Next  and press the Enter key.\nThe installer prompts you to confirm that you want to erase the entire disk.\n\nChoose Yes and press the Enter key to accept and proceed with the installation.\nStep 9: Select an Installation Option\nAfter partitioning, the installer prompts you to select one of three installation options:\n\nEach install option provides a different run-time environment. Select the option that best meets your requirements.\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPhoton Minimal\nPhoton Minimum is a very lightweight version of the container host runtime that is best suited for container management and hosting. There is sufficient packaging and functionality to allow most common operations around modifying existing containers, as well as being a highly performant and full-featured runtime.\n\n\nPhoton Full\nPhoton Full includes several additional packages to enhance the authoring and packaging of containerized applications and/or system customization. For simply running containers, Photon Full will be overkill. Use Photon Full for developing and packaging the application that will be run as a container, as well as authoring the container, itself. For testing and validation purposes, Photon Full will include all components necessary to run containers.\n\n\nPhoton OSTree Server\nThis installation profile will create the server instance that will host the filesystem tree and managed definitions for rpm-ostree managed hosts created with the \"Photon OSTree Host\" installation profile. Most environments should need only one Photon OSTree Server instance to manage the state of the Photon OSTree Hosts. Use Photon OSTree Server when you are establishing a new repository and management node for Photon OS hosts.\n\n\n\nNote: The option you choose determines the disk and memory resources required for your installation.\nSelect the option you want and press the Enter key.\nStep 10: Select the Linux Kernel\nThe installer prompts you to select the Linux kernel to install:\n\n\nHypervisor optimized means that any components that are not needed for running under a VMware hypervisor have been removed for faster boot times.\nGeneric means that all components are included.\n\nStep 11: Specify the Hostname\nThe installer prompts you for a hostname and suggest a randomly generated, unique hostname that you can change if you want.\n\nPress the Enter key.\nStep 12: Specify the System root Password\nNote: Photon OS will not permit commonly used dictionary words to be set as a root password.\nThe installer prompts you to enter the system root password. Type the password, and then press the Enter key.\n\nConfirm the root password by typing it a second time.\n\nPress the Enter key. The installer proceeds to install the software. Installation times will vary based on the system hardware and installation options you selected. Most installations complete in less than one minute.\nOnce finished, the installer displays a confirmation message (which includes how long it took to install Photon OS) and prompts you to press a key on your keyboard to boot the new VM.\n\nStep 13: Reboot the VM and Log In\nPress any key on the keyboard and the virtual machine will reboot into Photon OS.\n\nAs the initial boot process begins, the installer displays the Photon splash screen, and then a login prompt.\nAt the login prompt, enter root  as the username and provide the password chosen during the installation.\n\nYou have now successfully setup Photon OS and are ready to use your container run-time environment. Proceed to the next section to deploy a containerized application.\nDeploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS\nNow that you have your container runtime environment up and running, you can easily deploy a containerized application. For this example, you will deploy the popular open source Web Server Nginx. The Nginx application has a customized VMware package that is published as a dockerfile and can be downloaded, directly, through the Docker module from the Docker Hub.\nStep 1: Run Docker\nTo run Docker from the command prompt, enter the following command, which initializes the docker engine:\nsystemctl start docker\nTo ensure Docker daemon service runs on every subsequent VM reboot, enter the following command:\nsystemctl enable docker\nStep 2: Run the Nginx Web Server\nNow the Docker daemon service is running, it is a simple task to \"pull\" and start the Nginx Web Server container from Docker Hub. To do this, type the following command:\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\nThis pulls the Nginx Web Server files and appropriate dependent container filesystem layers required for this containerized application to run.\n\nAfter the docker run process completes, you return to the command prompt. You now have a fully active website up and running in a container.\nStep 3: Test the Web Server\nTo test that your Web Server is active, run the ifconfig command to get the IP address of the Photon OS Virtual Machine.\n\nThe output displays a list of adapters that are connected to the virtual machine. Typically, the web server daemon will be bound on \"eth0.\"\nStart a browser on your host machine and enter the IP address of your Photon OS Virtual Machine. You should see a screen similar to the following example as confirmation that your web server is active.\n\nYou can now run any other containerized application from Docker Hub or your own containerized application within Photon OS.\nInstalling Photon OS 1.0\nThis section provides setup instructions for Photon OS 1.0.\nPhoton OS 1.0 Prerequisites\nIn order to install and start using Photon OS with VMware Fusion the following pre-requisites must be satisfied:\n\nVMware Fusion or VMware Workstation must be installed\nRecommended 2GB of free RAM\nRecommended at least 300MB of free disk space\nPhoton OS ISO or OVA\n\nImporting the Photon OS 1.0 OVA\nUsing the OVA is the easiest way to create a Photon OS VM. Once you’ve downloaded the OVA, open VMware Fusion and select, “Import …” from the File menu. This will open the “Choose an Existing Virtual Machine” wizard. Use the “Choose File …” button to locate and select the Photon OS OVA.\nNote: The “Import” operation is specific to Fusion. For Workstation users, simply double-clicking on the OVA will start the import. \n\nClick “Continue” and provide the name and storage location for your Photon OS VM. Then, click \"Save.\"\n\nClicking “Save” will immediately present the Photon OS EULA. In order to start the import process, you'll need to click \"Accept\" to accept the EULA. \n\nOnce the import is complete, you should get confirmation that the import was Finished and a summary of the settings for your Photon OS VM. Click “Customize Settings” to change the operating system, as recognized by the hypervisor. Within the \"General\" System Settings for the newly imported VM, click the selection box next to \"OS\" and select, \"VMware Photon 64-bit,\" as shown below.\n \nClose the settings window and your Photon OS VM is ready to power on.\n\nClicking “Finish” will immediately power on your Photon OS VM. Once the VM is booted, you will be presented with a login prompt. Because of limitations within OVA support on Fusion and Workstation, it was necessary to specify a default password for the OVA option. However, all Photon OS instances that are created by importing the OVA will require an immediate password change upon login. The default account credentials are:\nUsername: root\nPassword: changeme\nAs soon as you enter these credentials, you will be forced to create a new password by entering the new password twice before you can access the shell prompt.\n\n \nInstalling Photon OS 1.0 on VMware Fusion from an ISO Image\nWith the latest Photon OS ISO image downloaded into a folder of your choice, Open VMware Fusion and Select “File->New.” The following screen will appear: \nNew\">\nSelect \"Create a custom virtual machine\" from the \"Select the Installation Method\" dialog, then, click continue. On the \"Choose Operating System\" dialog, select, \"Linux\" in the left-hand column and \"VMware Photon 64-bit\" in the right-hand column. \n\nUnless you're installing into an existing machine, select, \"Create a new virtual disk\" from the \"Choose a Virtual Disk dialog, then click \"Continue.\"\n\nYou're almost finished; but, before finishing the Photon OS Virtual Machine Creation, we strongly recommend that you customize the virtual machine and remove any unwanted devices that are not needed for a container runtime environment.  \n \nTo remove unnecessary devices, from the screen shown below, select “Customize Settings.\"\nFirst, choose a name for your Virtual Machine and the folder into which you would like to create the Virtual Machine.  If the default folder of “Virtual Machines” is acceptable, click “Save”.  \n\nThe virtual machine will be created and a new screen will appear, as shown below, that will allow virtual hardware customization to the new virtual machine. If it does not automatically appear, open \"Settings\" from the Virtual Machine menu bar. \n\nIt is our recommendation that the following components are removed, since they’re not used by Photon OS:\n\nSelect “Sound Card” and un-tick the “Connect Sound Card” Option and click \"Remove Sound Card.\" Confirm your action and return to the VM Settings by clicking “Show All.”\nSelect “Camera” and press the “Remove Camera” button in the bottom left hand corner, confirm your action and then select “Show All” to return to the VM Settings.\nSelect “Printer” and press the “Remove Printer Port” button in the bottom left hand corner, confirm your action and then select “Show All” to return to the VM Settings.\nSelect “USB & Bluetooth” and uncheck the “Share Bluetooth devices with Linux” setting and then select “Show All”\nSelect “Display” and ensure that the “Accelerate 3D Graphics” option is unchecked (it should be unchecked, by default) and, then, return to the VM Settings by selecting “Show All.”\nSelect “Advanced” and ensure that the “Pass Power Status to VM” option is unchecked. Select “Show All,\" but do not close the VM Settings window.\n\nAt this stage we have now made all the necessary customizations and we are ready to select the Photon OS ISO image to boot and begin the installation process. \nFrom the Virtual Machine Settings menu in Fusion, select \"CD/DVD (IDE)\" and, as shown below, point to the downloaded Photon OS ISO and ensure that there is a check in the \"Connect CD/DVD Drive\" box.\n\nReturn to the Fusion main menu, select the Photon OS Virtual Machine and press the “Play” button to power on the host and start the installation.\nWithin a few seconds the Photon OS Installer Boot Menu will appear.\n\nSelect – “Install” to proceed. \n\nAfter you accept the EULA, the Installer will detect one disk, which should be the 8GB volume configured as part of the virtual machine creation. Select the disk and press enter.  You will be prompted to confirm it is okay to erase the entire disk, select “Yes” to accept and proceed with the installation.\nYou will now be presented with four installation options:\n\nEach install option provides a different runtime environment, depending on your requirements:\n\nPhoton Minimal: Photon Minimum is a very lightweight version of the container host runtime that is best suited for container management and hosting. There is sufficient packaging and functionality to allow most common operations around modifying existing containers, as well as being a highly performant and full-featured runtime. \n\nPhoton Full: Photon Full includes several additional packages to enhance the authoring and packaging of containerized applications and/or system customization.

Photon OS provides a secure run-time environment for efficiently running containers. For an overview, see  https://vmware.github.io/photon/.\nRequirements\nUsing Photon OS within VMware Workstation requires the following resources:\n\n\n\nResource\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nVMware Workstation\nVMware Workstation must be installed (Workstation 10 or higher). The latest version is recommended.\n\n\nMemory\n2GB of free RAM (recommended)\n\n\nStorage\nMinimal Photon install : 512MB of free space (minimum); Full Photon install : 4GB of free space (minimum); 8GB is recommended\n\n\nDistribution File\nPhoton OS ISO or OVA file downloaded from bintray (https://bintray.com/vmware/photon/).\n\n\n\nResource requirements and recommendations vary depending on several factors, including the host environment (for example, VMware Workstation and VMware vSphere), the distribution file used (ISO or OVA), and the selected installation settings (for example, full or basic installation).\nNote:  The setup instructions in this guide use VMware Workstation Professional version 12.5.7.\n\nDeciding Whether to Use OVA or ISO\nThe first step is decide whether to use the the OVA or ISO distribution to set up Photon OS.\n\nOVA import : Because of the nature of an OVA, you're getting a pre-installed version of Photon OS. For Workstation, choose the OVA with Hardware Version 11 (not 13). The OVA benefits from a simple import process and some kernel tuning for VMware environments. However, because it's a pre-installed version, the set of packages that are installed are predetermined. Any additional packages that you need can be installed using tdnf.\nISO install : The ISO, on the other hand, allows for a more complete installation or automated installation via kickstart.\n\nIf you're just looking for the fastest way to get up and running, start with the OVA.\nDownloading Photon OS\nOnce you've decided which way to install, you'll need to download the correct binaries. Go to the following Bintray URL and download the latest release of Photon OS:\nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon/\nFor instructions, see Downloading Photon OS.\nImporting the OVA for Photon OS 2.0\nUsing the OVA is the easiest way to create a Photon OS VM on VMware Workstation.\nStep 1: Start the Import Process\nAfter you've downloaded the OVA file (OVA with Hardware Version 11), do one of the following:\n\nDouble-click it to start the import process, or\nStart VMware Workstation and, from the File menu, choose Open.\n\n\nStep 2: Specify the Name and Storage Location\nChange the name and storage location, if you want.\n\nChoose Import.\n\nReview the License Agreement and choose Accept.\nStep 3: Configure VM Settings\nOnce the OVA is imported, Workstation displays a summary of the settings for your Photon OS VM.\n\nChoose Edit virtual machine settings. Workstation displays the Virtual Machine settings. You can either accept the defaults or change settings as needed.\n\nSelect the Options tab.\n\nUnder Guest operating system, select Linux.\nFor Version, click the list and select VMWare Photon 64-bit.\n\nNote:  If you want to configure a secure boot for the Photon OS VM, select Advanced  and select (check) Boot with EFI instead of BIOS. The EFI boot ensures that the ISO content is signed by VMware and that the entire stack is secure.\n\nChoose OK.\nStep 4: Power on the VM\nFrom the tab, choose  Power on this virtual machine.\n\nAfter the splash screen, Workstation will prompt you to log in.\nStep 5: Update Login Credentials\nNote : Because of limitations within OVA support on Workstation, it was necessary to specify a default password for the OVA option. However, all Photon OS instances that are created by importing the OVA will require an immediate password change upon login. The default account credentials are:\n\n\n\nSetting\nValue\n\n\n\n\nUsername\nroot\n\n\nPassword\nchangeme\n\n\n\nAfter you provide these credentials, Workstation prompts you to create a new password and type it a second time to verify it. For security, Photon OS forbids common dictionary words for the root password. Once logged in, you will see the shell prompt.\n\nOnce complete, proceed to Deploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS.\nInstalling the ISO Image for Photon OS 2.0\nAfter you have downloaded the Photon OS ISO image into a folder of your choice, open VMware Workstation.\nStep 1: Start the Installation Process\nFrom the File menu, choose New Virtual Machine  to create a new virtual machine.\n\nSelect Typical or Custom, and then choose Next. These instructions refer to a Typical installation.\n\nStep 2: Select the ISO Image\nSelect Installer disc image file (iso), choose Browse and select the Photon OS ISO file.\n\nStep 3: Select the Operating System\nChoose Next. Select the Guest operating system.\nFor the Guest operating system, select Linux.\nClick the Version dropdown and select VMware Photon 64-bit  from the list.\n\nStep 4: Specify the VM Name and Location\nChoose Next. Specify a virtual machine name and location.\n\nStep 5: Specify Disk Options\nChoose Next. Specify the maximum disk size and whether you want to split the virtual disk into multiple files or store it as a single file.\n\nStep 6: Configure VM Settings\nChoose Next. Workstation displays a summary of your selections.\n\nImportant : Before you finish creating the Photon OS Virtual Machine, we strongly recommend that you customize the virtual machine and remove any unwanted devices that are not needed for a container run-time environment. To remove unnecessary devices, choose Customize hardware.\n\nConsider removing the following components, which are not used by Photon OS:\n\nSelect Sound Card, un-tick the Connect at power on option. Confirm your action and choose Close to return to the VM Settings by .\nSelect USB Controller and ensure that the Share Bluetooth devices with the virtual machine setting is unchecked (it should be unchecked, by default) and then choose Close.\nSelect Display and ensure that the Accelerate 3D Graphics option is unchecked (it should be unchecked, by default) and then choose Close.\nAt this stage we have now made all the necessary customizations and you are ready to select the Photon OS ISO image to boot and begin the installation process.\nChoose  Finish.\n\nIn Workstation, choose Edit virtual machine settings, select CD/DVD (IDE), and verify that Connect at power on is selected.\n\nStep 7: Configure a Secure Boot (Optional)\nNote:  If you want to configure a secure boot for the Photon OS VM, in Workstation, choose  Edit virtual machine settings, select  Options, choose Advanced, and select Boot with EFI instead of BIOS.\n\nThe EFI boot ensures that the ISO content is signed by VMware and that the entire stack is secure.\nChoose OK.\n\nStep 8: Power On the VM\nChoose Power on this virtual machine.\nWhen you see the Photon Installer boot menu, press Enter on your keyboard to start installing.\n\nReview the license agreement.\n\nChoose Accept and press Enter.\nStep 9: Configure the Partition\nThe installer will detect one disk, which should be the 8GB volume configured as part of the virtual machine creation. Choose Auto  to have the installer automatically allocate the partition, or choose Custom  if you want to configure individual partitions, and then press the Enter key.\n\nNote:  If you choose Custom, the installer displays the following screen.\n\nFor each custom partition, choose Create New  and specify the following information:\n\nSize - Preallocated size of this partition, in MB.\nType - One of the following options:\n\next3 - ext3 file system\next4 - ext4 file system\nswap - swap partition\n\nMountpoint - Mount point for this partition.\nChoose OK and press the Enter key. When you are done defining custom partitions, choose Next and press the Enter key.\nThe installer prompts you to confirm that you want to erase the entire disk. Choose  Yes  and press the Enter key.\n\nStep 10: Select an Installation Option\nAfter partitioning the disk, the installer will prompt you to select an installation option.\n\nEach installation option provides a different run-time environment, depending on your requirements.\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPhoton Minimal\nPhoton Minimum is a very lightweight version of the container host runtime that is best suited for container management and hosting. There is sufficient packaging and functionality to allow most common operations around modifying existing containers, as well as being a highly performant and full-featured runtime.\n\n\nPhoton Full\nPhoton Full includes several additional packages to enhance the authoring and packaging of containerized applications and/or system customization. For simply running containers, Photon Full will be overkill. Use Photon Full for developing and packaging the application that will be run as a container, as well as authoring the container, itself. For testing and validation purposes, Photon Full will include all components necessary to run containers.\n\n\nPhoton OSTree Server\nThis installation profile will create the server instance that will host the filesystem tree and managed definitions for rpm-ostree managed hosts created with the \"Photon OSTree Host\" installation profile. Most environments should need only one Photon OSTree Server instance to manage the state of the Photon OSTree Hosts. Use Photon OSTree Server when you are establishing a new repository and management node for Photon OS hosts.\n\n\n\nNote:  The option you choose determines the disk and memory resources required for your installation.\nSelect the option you want and press the Enter key.\nStep 11: Select the Linux Kernel\nSelect a Linux kernel to install.\n\n\nHypervisor optimized means that any components that are not needed for running under a VMware hypervisor have been removed for faster boot times.\nGeneric means that all components are included.\n\nChoose Next and press the Enter key.\nStep 12: Specify the Hostname\nThe installer prompts you for a hostname and suggest a randomly generated, unique hostname that you can change if you want.\n\nPress the Enter key.\nStep 13: Specify the System root Password\nNote : Photon OS will not permit commonly used dictionary words to be set as a root password.\nThe installer prompts you to enter the system root password. Type the password and press the Enter key.\n\nThe installer prompts you to confirm the root password by typing it a second time.\n\nPress the Enter key. The installer proceeds to install the software. Installation times will vary based on the system hardware and installation options you selected. Most installations complete in less than one minute.\nStep 14: Reboot the VM and Log In\nOnce finished, the installer displays a confirmation message (which includes how long it took to install Photon OS) and prompts you to press a key on your keyboard to boot the new VM.\n\nPress any key on the keyboard and the virtual machine will reboot into Photon OS.\nAs the initial boot process begins, the installer displays the Photon splash screen, and then a login prompt.\n\nAt the login prompt, type root  as the username and provide the password chosen during the installation.\n\nYou have now successfully set up Photon OS and are ready to use your container run-time environment. Proceed to the next section to deploy a containerized application.\nDeploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS\nNow that you have your container runtime environment up and running, you can easily deploy a containerized application. For this example, you will deploy the popular open source Web Server Nginx. The Nginx application has a customized VMware package that is published as a dockerfile and can be downloaded directly through the Docker module from the Docker Hub.\nStep 1: Run Docker\nTo run Docker from the command prompt, enter the following command, which initializes the docker engine:\nsystemctl start docker\nTo ensure Docker daemon service runs on every subsequent VM reboot, enter the following command:\nsystemctl enable docker\nStep 2: Run the Nginx Web Server\nNow the Docker daemon service is running, it is a simple task to \"pull\" and start the Nginx Web Server container from Docker Hub. To do this, type the following command:\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\nThis pulls the Nginx Web Server files and appropriate dependent container filesystem layers required for this containerized application to run.\n\nAfter the docker run  process completes, you return to the command prompt. You now have a fully active website up and running in a container.\nStep 3: Test the Web Server\nTo test that your Web Server is active, run the ifconfig command to get the IP address of the Photon OS Virtual Machine.\n\nThe output displays a list of adapters that are connected to the virtual machine. Typically, the web server daemon will be bound on \"eth0\".\nStart a browser on your host machine and enter the IP address of your Photon OS Virtual Machine (the inet addr for eth0). You should see a screen similar to the following example as confirmation that your web server is active.\n\nYou can now run any other containerized application from Docker Hub or your own containerized application within Photon OS.\nInstalling Photon OS 1.0\nRefer to the Photon OS 1.0 installation instructions in Running Photon OS on Fusion.\n"},"Running-Photon-OS-on-Amazon-Elastic-Cloud-Compute.html":{"url":"Running-Photon-OS-on-Amazon-Elastic-Cloud-Compute.html","title":"Running Photon OS on AWS EC2","keywords":"","body":"Running Photon OS on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute\nThis guide describes how to get Photon OS up and running on Amazon Web Services Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2), customize Photon with cloud-init, connect to it with SSH, and run a containerized application.\nAbout Photon OS?\nPhoton OS™ is an open source Linux container host optimized for cloud-native applications, cloud platforms, and VMware infrastructure. Photon OS provides a secure run-time environment for efficiently running containers. For an overview, see https://vmware.github.io/photon/.\nPrerequisites\nUsing Photon OS within AWS EC2 requires the following resources:\n\nAWS account. Working with EC2 requires an Amazon account for AWS with valid payment information. Keep in mind that, if you try the examples in this document, you will be charged by Amazon. See Setting Up with Amazon EC2.\nAmazon tools. The following examples also assume that you have installed and configured the Amazon AWS CLI and the EC2 CLI and AMI tools, including ec2-ami-tools.\n\nSee Installing the AWS Command Line Interface, Setting Up the Amazon EC2 Command Line Interface Tools on Linux, and Configuring AWS Command-Line Interface. Also see Setting Up the AMI Tools.\nThis article uses an Ubuntu 14.04 workstation to generate the keys and certificates that AWS requires.\nDownloading the Photon OS Image for Amazon\nVMware packages Photon OS as a cloud-ready Amazon machine image (AMI) that you can download for free from Bintray.\nDownload the Photon OS AMI now and save it on your workstation. For instructions, see Downloading Photon OS.\nNote: The AMI version of Photon is a virtual appliance with the information and packages that Amazon needs to launch an instance of Photon in the cloud. To build the AMI version, VMware starts with the minimal version of Photon OS and adds the sudo and tar packages to it. \nGetting Photon OS Up and Running on EC2\nTo run Photon OS on EC2, you must use cloud-init with an EC2 data source. The cloud-init service configures the cloud instance of a Linux image. An instance is a virtual server in the Amazon cloud. \nThe examples in this article show how to generate SSH and RSA keys for your Photon instance, upload the Photon OS .ami image to the Amazon cloud, and configure it with cloud-init. In many of the examples, you must replace information with your own paths, account details, or other information from Amazon. \nStep 1: Create a Key Pair\nThe first step is to generate SSH keys on, for instance, an Ubuntu workstation: \nssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/mykeypair\nThe command generates a public key in the file with a .pub extension and a private key in a file with no extension. Keep the private key file and remember the name of your key pair; the name is the file name of the two files without an extension. You'll need the name later to connect to the Photon instance.\nChange the mode bits of the public key pair file to protect its security. In the command, include the path to the file if you need to. \nchown 600 mykeypair.pub\nChange the mode bits on your private key pair file so that only you can view it:\nchmod 400 mykeypair\nTo import your public key pair file (but not your private key pair file), connect to the EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ and select the region for the key pair. A key pair works in only one region, and the instance of Photon that will be uploaded later must be in the same region as the key pair. Select key pairs under Network & Security, and then import the public key pair file that you generated earlier. \nFor more information, see Importing Your Own Key Pair to Amazon EC2.\nStep 2: Generate a Certificate\nWhen you bundle up an image for EC2, Amazon requires an RSA user signing certificate. You create the certificate by using openssl to first generate a private RSA key and then to generate the RSA certificate that references the private RSA key. Amazon uses the pairing of the private key and the user signing certificate for  handshake verification. \nFirst, on Ubuntu 14.04 or another workstation that includes openssl, run the following command to generate a private key. If you change the name of the key, keep in mind that you will need to include the name of the key in the next command, which generates the certificate. \nopenssl genrsa 2048 > myprivatersakey.pem\nRemember where you store your private key locally; you'll need it again later. \nSecond, run the following command to generate the certificate. The command prompts you to provide more information, but because you are generating a user signing certificate, not a server certificate, you can just type Enter for each prompt to leave all the fields blank. \nopenssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -key myprivatersakey.pem -outform PEM -out certificate.pem\nFor more information, see the Create a Private Key and the Create the User Signing Certificate sections of Setting Up the AMI Tools.\nThird, upload to AWS the certificate value from the certificate.pem file that you created in the previous command. Go to the Identity and Access Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/, navigate to the name of your user, open the Security Credentials section, click Manage Signing Certificates, and then click Upload Signing Certificate. Open certificate.pem in a text editor, copy and paste the contents of the file into the Certificate Body field, and then click Upload Signing Certificate.\nFor more information, see the Upload the User Signing Certificate section of Setting Up the AMI Tools.\nStep 3: Create a Security Group\nThe next prerequisite is to create a security group and set it to allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS connections over ports 22, 80, and 443, respectively. Connect to the EC2 command-line interface and run the following commands: \naws ec2 create-security-group --group-name photon-sg --description \"My Photon security group\"\n{\n    \"GroupId\": \"sg-d027efb4\"\n}\naws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name photon-sg --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0\nThe GroupId is returned by EC2. Write it down; you'll need it later.\nBy using 0.0.0.0/0 for SSH ingress on Port 22, you are opening the port to all IP addresses--which is not a security best practice but a convenience for the examples in this article. For a production instance or other instances that are anything more than temporary machines, you should authorize only a specific IP address or range of addresses. See Amazon's document on Authorizing Inbound Traffic for Linux Instances.\nRepeat the command to allow incoming traffic on Port 80 and on Port 443: \naws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name photon-sg --protocol tcp --port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0\n\naws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name photon-sg --protocol tcp --port 443 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0\nCheck your work: \naws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-names photon-sg\nStep 4: Extract the Tarball\nNext, make a directory to store the image, and then extract the Photon OS image from its archive by running the following tar command. (You might have to change the file name to match the version you have.)    \nmkdir bundled\ntar -zxvf ./photon-ami.tar.gz\nStep 5: Bundle the Image\nThe next step is to run the ec2-bundle-image command to create an instance store-backed Linux AMI from the Photon OS image that you extracted in the previous step. The result of the ec2-bundle-image command is a manifest that describes the machine in an XML file. \nThe command uses the certificate path to your PEM-encoded RSA public key certificate file; the path to your PEM-encoded RSA private key file; your EC2 user account ID; the correct architecture for Photon OS; the path to the Photon OS AMI image extracted from its tar file; and the bundled directory from the previous step. \nYou must replace the values of the certificate path, the private key, and the user account with your own values.\n$ ec2-bundle-image --cert certificate.pem --privatekey myprivatersakey.pem --user   --arch x86_64 --image photon-ami.raw --destination ./bundled/\nStep 6: Put the Bundle in a Bucket\nNext, make an S3 bucket, replacing  with the name that you want. The command creates the bucket in the region specified in your Amazon configuration file, which should be the same region in which you are using your key pair file: \n$ aws s3 mb s3://\nNow upload the bundle to the Amazon S3 cloud. The following command includes the path to the XML file containing the manifest for the Photon OS machine created during the previous step, though you might have to change the file name to match the version you have. The manifest file is typically located in the same directory as the bundle. \nThe command also includes the name of the Amazon S3 bucket in which the bundle is to be stored; your AWS access key ID; and your AWS secret access key.\n$ ec2-upload-bundle --manifest ./bundled/photon-ami.manifest.xml --bucket  --access-key  --secret-key \nStep 7: Register the Image\nThe final step in creating an AMI before you can launch it is to register it. The following command includes a name for the AMI, its architecture, and its virtualization type. The virtualization type for Photon OS is hvm.\n$ ec2-register /photon-ami.manifest.xml --name photon-ami --architecture x86_64 --virtualization-type hvm\nOnce registered, you can launch as many new instances as you want.\nStep 8: Run an Instance of the Image with Cloud-Init\nNow things get a little tricky. In the following command, the user-data-file option instructs cloud-init to import the cloud-config data in user-data.txt.  \nThe command also includes the ID of the AMI, which you can obtain by running ec2-describe-images; the instance type of m3.medium, which is a general purpose instance type; and the name of key pair, which should be replaced with your own--otherwise, you won't be able to connect to the instance. \nBefore you run the command, change directories to the directory containing the mykeypair file and add the path to the user-data.txt. \n$ ec2-run-instances  --instance-type m3.medium -g photon-sg --key mykeypair --user-data-file user-data.txt\nHere are the contents of the user-data.txt file that cloud-init applies to the machine the first time it boots up in the cloud.  \n#cloud-config\nhostname: photon-on-01\ngroups:\n- cloud-admins\n- cloud-users\nusers:\n- default\n- name: photonadmin\n   gecos: photon test admin user\n   primary-group: cloud-admins\n   groups: cloud-users\n   lock-passwd: false\n   passwd: vmware\n- name: photonuser\n   gecos: photon test user\n   primary-group: cloud-users\n   groups: users\n   passwd: vmware\npackages:\n- vim\nStep 9: Get the IP Address of Your Image\nNow run the following command to check on the state of the instance that you launched: \n$ ec2-describe-instances\nFinally, you can obtain the external IP address of the instance by running the following query: \n$ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids  --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PublicIpAddress' --output=text\nIf need be, check the cloud-init output log file on EC2 at /var/log/cloud-init-output.log to see how EC2 handled the settings in the cloud-init data file. \nFor more information on using cloud-init user data on EC2, see Running Commands on Your Linux Instance at Launch.\nDeploy a Containerized Application in Photon OS\nThis section shows you how to connect to the Photon instance by using SSH and to launch a web server by running it in Docker.\nStep 1: Connect with SSH\nConnect to the instance over SSH by specifying the private key (.pem) file and the user name for the Photon machine, which is root:\nssh -i ~/.ssh/mykeypair root@\nFor complete instructions, see Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH. \nStep 2: Run Docker\nOn the minimal version of Photon OS, the docker engine is enabled and running by default, which you can see by running the following command: \nsystemctl status docker\nStep 3: Start the Web Server\nNote: Please make sure that the proper security policies have been enabled on the Amazon AWS side to enable traffic to port 80 on the VM. \nSince Docker is running, you can run an application in a container--for example, the Nginx Web Server. This example uses the popular open source web server Nginx. The Nginx application has a customized VMware package that the Docker engine can download directly from the Docker Hub.\nTo pull Nginx from its Docker Hub and start it, run the following command: \ndocker run -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\nThe Nginx web server should be bound to the public DNS value for  the instance of Photon OS--that is, the same address with which you connected over SSH. \nStep 4: Test the Web Server\nOn your local workstation, open a web browser and go to the the public address of the Photon OS instance running Docker. The following screen should appear, showing that the web server is active:\n\nWhen you're done, halt the Docker container by typing Ctrl+c in the SSH console where you are connected to EC2. \nYou can now run other containerized applications from the Docker Hub or your own containerized application on Photon OS in the Amazon cloud. \nLaunching the Web Server with Cloud-Init\nTo eliminate the manual effort of running Docker, you can add docker run and its arguments to the cloud-init user data file by using runcmd: \n#cloud-config\nhostname: photon-on-01\ngroups:\n- cloud-admins\n- cloud-users\nusers:\n- default\n- name: photonadmin\n   gecos: photon test admin user\n   primary-group: cloud-admins\n   groups: cloud-users\n   lock-passwd: false\n   passwd: vmware\n- name: photonuser\n   gecos: photon test user\n   primary-group: cloud-users\n   groups: users\n   passwd: vmware\npackages:\n- vim\nruncmd:\n- docker run -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\nTo try this addition, you'll have to run another instance with this new cloud-init data source and then get the instance's public IP address to check that the Nginx web server is running. \nTerminating the AMI Instance\nBecause Amazon charges you while the instance is running, make sure to shut it down when you're done.  \nFirst, get the ID of the AMI so you can terminate it: \n$ ec2-describe-instances\nFinally, terminate the Photon OS instance by running the following command, replacing the placeholder with the ID that the ec2-describe-images command returned. If you ran a second instance of Photon OS with the cloud-init file that runs docker, terminate that instance, too. \n$ ec2-terminate-instances \n"},"Running-Photon-OS-on-Microsoft-Azure.html":{"url":"Running-Photon-OS-on-Microsoft-Azure.html","title":"Running Photon OS on Microsoft Azure","keywords":"","body":"Running Photon OS on Microsoft Azure\nPhoton OS can serve as a run-time environment for Linux containers on Microsoft Azure.

Before you run it, specify the following settings:\n\nresource_group name\naccount_name\naccount_key (public or private)\ncontainer_name\npublic_key_file\nvhd_path and and vm_name of the Photon OS VHD distribution file\n\nThis script returns the complete IP address of the newly created VM.\n#!/bin/bash\nvhd_path=$1\nvm_name=$2\nexport PATH=$PATH:/root/azure_new/bin/az\necho PATH=$PATH\nresource_group=&quot;&quot;\naccount_name=&quot;&quot;\naccount_key=&quot;&quot;\ncontainer_name=&quot;mydisks&quot;\nurl=&quot;https://${account_name}.blob.core.windows.net/${container_name}/${vm_name}.vhd&quot;\npublic_key_file=&quot;/root/azure_new/jenkins.pub&quot;\necho &quot;########################&quot;\necho &quot;#   Create container   #&quot;\necho &quot;########################&quot;\n/root/azure_new/bin/az storage container create --account-name ${account_name} --name ${container_name}\necho &quot;##################&quot;\necho &quot;#   Upload vhd   #&quot;\necho &quot;##################&quot;\n/root/azure_new/bin/az storage blob upload --account-name ${account_name} \\\n    --account-key ${account_key} \\\n    --container-name ${container_name} \\\n    --type page \\\n    --file ${vhd_path} \\\n    --name ${vm_name}.vhd\necho &quot;##################&quot;\necho &quot;#   Create vm    #&quot;\necho &quot;##################&quot;\necho &quot;az vm create --resource-group ${resource_group} --location westus --name ${vm_name} --storage-account ${account_name} --os-type linux --admin-username michellew --ssh-key-value ${public_key_file} --image ${url} --use-unmanaged-disk ... ...&quot;\n/root/azure_new/bin/az vm create --resource-group ${resource_group} --location westus --name ${vm_name} --storage-account ${account_name} --os-type linux --admin-username michellew --ssh-key-value ${public_key_file} --image ${url} --use-unmanaged-disk\nRemoving Photon OS from Azure\nYou can use the following delete.sh script to programmatically (and silently) remove the VM instance, VHD file, and container.\nNote:  Consider deleting idle VMs so that you are not charged when not in use.\nBefore you run it, specify the following settings:\n\nresource_group name (from step 1, above)\naccount_name (from step 2, above)\naccount_key (public or private) (from step 3, above)\ncontainer_name (from step 4, above)\npublic_key_file\nvm_name of the Photon OS VHD distribution file\n\ndelete.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nvm_name=$1\nresource_group=&quot;&quot;\naccount_name=&quot;&quot;\naccount_key=&quot;&quot;\ncontainer_name=&quot;mydisks&quot;\nurl=&quot;https://${account_name}.blob.core.windows.net/${container_name}/${vm_name}.vhd&quot;\npublic_key_file=&quot;/root/azure_new/jenkins.pub&quot;\nexit_code=0\necho &quot;##################&quot;\necho &quot;#   Delete vm    #&quot;\necho &quot;##################&quot;\necho &quot;az vm list  --resource-group ${resource_group} ... ...&quot;\n/root/azure_new/bin/az vm list  --resource-group ${resource_group}\necho &quot;az vm delete --resource-group ${resource_group} --name ${vm_name} --yes ... ...&quot;\n/root/azure_new/bin/az vm delete --resource-group ${resource_group} --name ${vm_name} --yes\nif [$? -ne 0];then\n   exit_code=1\nfi\necho &quot;az vm list  --resource-group ${resource_group} ... ...&quot;\n/root/azure_new/bin/az vm list  --resource-group ${resource_group}\necho &quot;##############$####&quot;\necho &quot;#   Delete vhd    #&quot;\necho &quot;###############$###&quot;\necho &quot;az storage blob list --account-name ${account_name} --container-name ${container_name} ... ...&quot;\n/root/azure_new/bin/az storage blob list --account-name ${account_name} --container-name ${container_name}\necho &quot;az storage blob delete --account-name ${account_name} --container-name ${container_name} --name ${vm_name}.vhd ... ...&quot;\n/root/azure_new/bin/az storage blob delete --account-name ${account_name} --container-name ${container_name} --name ${vm_name}.vhd\nif [$? -ne 0];then\n   exit_code=1\nfi\necho &quot;az storage blob list --account-name ${account_name} --container-name ${container_name} ... ...&quot;\n/root/azure_new/bin/az storage blob list --account-name ${account_name} --container-name ${container_name}\necho &quot;########################&quot;\necho &quot;#   Delete container   #&quot;\necho &quot;########################&quot;\n/root/azure_new/bin/az storage container delete --account-name ${account_name} --name ${container_name}\n/root/azure_new/bin/az storage container delete --account-name ${account_name} --name vhds\nexit ${exit_code}\nDeploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS\nNow that you have your container runtime environment up and running, you can easily deploy a containerized application. For this example, you will deploy the popular open source Web Server Nginx. The Nginx application has a customized VMware package that is published as a dockerfile and can be downloaded, directly, through the Docker module from the Docker Hub.\nStep 1: Run Docker\nTo run Docker from the command prompt, enter the following command, which initializes the docker engine:\nsystemctl start docker\nTo ensure Docker daemon service runs on every subsequent VM reboot, enter the following command:\nsystemctl enable docker\nStep 2: Run the Nginx Web Server\nNow the Docker daemon service is running, it is a simple task to \"pull\" and start the Nginx Web Server container from Docker Hub. To do this, type the following command:\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\nThis pulls the Nginx Web Server files and appropriate dependent container filesystem layers required for this containerized application to run.\n\nAfter the \"docker run\" process completes, you return to the command prompt. You now have a fully active website up and running in a container.\nStep 3: Test the Web Server\nNote : Please make sure that the proper security policies have been enabled on the Microsoft Azure side to enable traffic to port 80 on the VM.\nTo test that your Web Server is active:\n\nRun the ifconfig command to get the IP address of the Photon OS Virtual Machine.\nThe output displays a list of adapters that are connected to the virtual machine. Typically, the web server daemon will be bound on \"eth0.\"\nStart a browser on your host machine and enter the IP address of your Photon OS Virtual Machine.\nYou should see a screen confirming that the nginx web server is successfully installed and working.\n\nYou can now run any other containerized application from Docker Hub or your own containerized application within Photon OS.\n"},"Running-Photon-OS-on-Google-Compute-Engine.html":{"url":"Running-Photon-OS-on-Google-Compute-Engine.html","title":"Running Photon OS on Google Compute Engine","keywords":"","body":"Running Photon OS on Google Compute Engine\nThis guide describes how to get started using Photon OS as a virtual machine on Google Compute Engine (GCE). Once Photon OS is installed as an image on GCE, this document shows how to deploy a containerized application in Docker with a single command.\n\nAbout Photon OS\nPrerequisites for Photon OS on GCE\nDownloading Photon OS\nInstalling Photon OS on Google Compute Engine\nDeploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS\n\nAbout Photon OS\nPhoton OS™ is an open source Linux container host optimized for cloud-native applications, cloud platforms, and VMware infrastructure. Photon OS provides a secure run-time environment for efficiently running containers. For an overview, see  https://vmware.github.io/photon/.\nPrerequisites for Photon OS on GCE\nUsing Photon OS on Google Compute Engine requires the following resources:\n\nAn account on Google Compute Engine\nThe Google Cloud SDK\nThe Photon OS image for GCE\n\nKeep in mind that, if you try the examples in this document, Google will charge your account for the cloud services that you use. The GCE-ready version of Photon OS, however, comes for free.\nDownloading Photon OS\nVMware recommends that administrators use the Photon OS image for Google Compute Engine (GCE) to create Photon OS instances on GCE. Although earlier releases of Photon OS required heavy modification of the Photon instance to make the image compatible with GCE, Photon OS 1.0 comes with pre-modified images for popular cloud providers, including GCE.\nYou can download the Photon OS image for GCE from the following URL:\nhttps://bintray.com/vmware/photon\nFor instructions, see Downloading Photon OS.\nInstalling Photon OS on Google Compute Engine\nAfter you download the Photon OS image for GCE, log into GCE and complete the following steps.\nStep 1: Create a New Bucket\nCreate a new bucket to store your Photon OS image for GCE.\n\nStep 2: Upload the Photon OS Image\nOnce you’ve created the bucket, you’re ready to upload the Photon OS image. While viewing the bucket that you’ve created, click the Upload files button, navigate to your Photon OS image and click the Choose button. \nAs the image below shows, when the upload finishes, you should see your Photon OS compressed image in the file list for the bucket that you created.\n\nStep 3: Create a New Image\nNext, you need to create a new image. Click on Images in the Compute category in the left panel; then, click on the New Image button. \nEnter a name for the image in the Name field and change the Source to Cloud Storage file using the pull-down menu. Then, in the Cloud Storage file field, enter the bucket name and filename as the path to the Photon OS image for GCE. In this example, where the bucket was named photon_storage, the path is as follows:\nphoton_storage/photon-gce-2.0-tar.gz\nNote: The new image form will autopopulate the gs:// file path prefix.\nAfter you’re finished completing the name and Cloud Storage object path, click the Create button to create your image. You should be returned to your Images catalog and your Photon OS image should be at the top of the list. \nStep 4: Create a New Instance\nTo create an instance, check the box next to the Photon OS image and click the Create Instance button. \nOn the Create a new instance form, provide a name for this instance, confirm the zone into which this instance is to be deployed and, before clicking Create, place a check in the boxes for Allow HTTP traffic and Allow HTTPS traffic. \nOutside of this demo, your application may or may not require these firewall rules. Please choose accordingly outside of this demo. However, since we will demonstrate a running web server container, we want these ports to be open for our instance. \n\nWhen the instance is created you will be returned to your list of VM instances. If you click on the instance, the status page for the instance will allow you to SSH into your Photon OS environment using the SSH button at the top of the panel. \nAt this point, your instance is running and you are ready to start the Docker engine and run a container workload.\nDeploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS\nNow that you have your container runtime environment up and running, you can easily deploy a containerized application. For this example, you will deploy the popular open source Web Server Nginx. The Nginx application has a customized VMware package that is published as a dockerfile and can be downloaded directly through the Docker module from the Docker Hub.\nStep 1: Run Docker\nTo run Docker from the command prompt, enter the command below to initialize the Docker engine:\nsystemctl start docker\nTo ensure Docker daemon service runs on every subsequent VM reboot, enter:\nsystemctl enable docker\nStep 2: Run the Nginx Web Server\nNow that the Docker daemon service is running, it is a simple task to pull and then start the Nginx Web Server container from Docker Hub.  To do this, type the following command:\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\nThis command pulls the Nginx Web Server files and the dependent containers to ensure this containerized application can run.  You will see a screenshot similar to the one below, as the container and dependencies are downloaded and the container is prepared to run:\n\nOnce the docker run process is completed, you will be returned to the command prompt.  You now have a fully active website up and running through typing just a single command within Photon OS using containers.\nStep 3: Test the Web Server\nNote : Please make sure that the proper security policies have been enabled on the Google GCE side to enable traffic to port 80 on the VM.\nTo test that your web server is active, we need to get the IP address of the Photon OS virtual machine. To get the IP address, enter the following command:\nThis command displays a list of network adapters connected to the virtual machine. Typically, the web server daemon will be bound to eth0; record the IP address associated with eth0. Alternatively, visit the status page of your Photon OS instance in GCE where the IP address is listed under External IP.\nStart a browser on your host machine and enter the IP address of your Photon OS virtual machine. The following screen should appear, showing that your web server is active:\n\nYou can now run any other containerized application from Docker Hub or your own containerized application within Photon OS.\n"},"gce.html":{"url":"gce.html","title":"Photon OS on GCE","keywords":"","body":"Photon OS on GCE\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) Image background\nGCE is a service that lets you run virtual machines on Google's infrastructure. You can customize the virtual machine as much as you want, and you can even install your own custom operating system image. Or, you can adopt one of the public images provided by Google. For any operating system to work with GCE, it must match Google's infrastructure needs. \nGoogle provides tools that VM instances require to work correctly on GCE:\n\nGoogle startup scripts: User can provide some startup script to configure their instances at startup.\nGoogle Daemon: Google Daemon creates new accounts and configures ssh to accept public keys using the metadata server.\nGoogle Cloud SDK: Command line tools to manage your images, instances and other objects on GCE.\n\nFollowing is the list (extracted from this link) of items that must be done to make Photon OS work on GCE:\n\nInstall Google Compute Engine Image packages\nInstall Google Cloud SDK\nChange GPT partition table to MBR \nUpdate the Grub config for new MBR and serial console output\nUpdate ssh configuration\nDelete ssh host keys\nSet the time zone to UTC\nUse the Google NTP server\nDelete the hostname file.\nAdd Google hosts /etc/hosts\nSet MTU to 1460. SSH will not work without it.\nCreate /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run with just the contents “GOOGLE\\n”.\n\nThe GCE-Ready Image of Photon OS\nThe latest version of Photon OS does all of this for you. It bundles the Google startup scripts, daemon, and cloud SDK into a GCE-ready image that has been modified to meet the configuration requirements of GCE. To download the GCE-ready image of Photon OS for free, go to Bintray. To use Photon OS with GCE, you do not need to perform the following steps unless you want to go through the exercise of customizing Photon OS to work with GCE. The Photon OS team has already done it for you. For more information, see Running Photon OS on Google Compute Engine. \nCreating Photon image for GCE\n1.

Thanks - the Photon OS Team\nWhat is Photon OS?\nPhoton OS is a tech preview of an open source, Linux container host runtime optimized for vSphere. Photon OS is extensible, lightweight, and supports the most common container formats including Docker, Rocket (rkt) and Garden.\nPhoton OS includes a small footprint, yum-compatible, package-based lifecycle management system – called “tdnf”- and, alternatively, supports an rpm-ostree image-based system versioning.\nWhen used with development tools and environments such as VMware Fusion, VMware Workstation, HashiCorp (Vagrant and Atlas) and production runtime environment (vSphere, vCloud Air), Photon OS allows seamless migration of container based apps from development to production.  \nIntroduction\nThis document explains how to get started using Photon OS as a runtime environment for Linux containers by running Photon OS as a VM instance on vCloud Air.  This guide will provide instructions on deploying Photon OS from the vCloud Air public catalog. \nOnce Photon OS is installed, this guide will also provide instructions on how to demonstrate how simple it can be to deploy a containerized application with Docker and will highlight the installation of a web server simply by running one command!\nPhoton OS on vCloud Air Prerequisites\nThe following items are required for preparing and launching Photon OS on Google Compute Engine:\n\nAn account on vCloud Air\n\nWith the TP2 release, Photon OS is published in the vCloud Air catalog. Therefore, it is no longer to download a Photon OS image before getting started. \nCreating a Photon OS Instance\nBegin by logging into your vCloud Air account and selecting the Service into which you'd like to deploy your Photon OS instance. In this example, we'll use the Virtual Private Cloud OnDemand Service. \n\nOnce you've selected the Service for your instance, you'll need to specify the Location for your virtual datacenter from the list of vCloud Air locations. Clicking \"Continue\" will start the process of creating your virtual datacenter, an associated gateway and a routed network. \nAfter vCloud Air is finished creating your virtual datacenter, you're ready to click the \"Create your first virtual machine\" button to create your Photon OS instance. \n\nWhen you click the \"Create your first virtual machine\" button, you'll be presented the list of templates available in vCloud Air. Select the \"64 Bit\" option of VMware Photon OS - Tech Preview 2 and click the \"Continue\" button.\n\nBefore vCloud Air can create your Photon OS VM, you need to confirm the hardware configuration. The defaults presented are the recommended values; adjust as necessary to accommodate the container workloads that you expect to run in this Photon OS instance. Once you're satisfied with the hardware configuration, click \"Create Virtual Machine\" Once complete, you should see your powered-on Photon OS instance ready to start the Docker engine and run a container workload.\nInstalling a Containerized Application to Help Demonstrate Capability\nNow that you have your container runtime environment up and running, you may be wondering, “what can I do now?” A command prompt is not the most exciting!  To help to demonstrate the ease in which you can deploy a containerized application, we will showcase how you can quickly get a Web Server up and running.\nFor this example, we will use the popular open source Web Server Nginx. The Nginx application has a customized VMware package and published as a dockerfile and can be downloaded, directly, through the Docker module from the Docker Hub.\nTo run Docker from the command prompt, enter the command below to initialize the Docker engine:\nsystemctl start docker\nTo ensure Docker daemon service runs on every subsequent VM reboot, enter:\nsystemctl enable docker\nNow the Docker daemon service is running, you're almost ready to “pull” and start the Nginx Web Server container from Docker Hub.  First, you'll need to ensure that you've configured your vCloud Air VM to be connected to the Internet by following the instructions found, here.  Once your Photon OS VM is connected to the Internet, the Docker engine can pull images from the Docker hub; to pull down the VMware-modified nginx container, type the following command:\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\nThis will then pull the Nginx Web Server files and appropriate dependent containers to ensure this containerized application can run.  You will see a screenshot similar to below, as the container and dependencies are downloaded and the container is prepared to run:\nOnce “docker run” process is completed, you will be returned to the command prompt.  You now have a fully active website up and running through typing just a single command within Photon OS using containers.\nTo test that your Web Server is active, we need to get the IP address of the Photon OS Virtual Machine. To get the IP address, enter the following command 'ifconfig'. This command will display a list of network adapters connected to the virtual machine.  Typically, the web server daemon will be bound on “eth0;” record the IP address associated with eth0.

It is a C implementation of the DNF package manager without Python dependencies. DNF is the next upcoming major version of yum. \nTdnf appears in the minimal and full versions of Photon OS.

If you receive an access error message when working with the photon-iso repository, it is probably because you do not have the Photon OS ISO mounted.

How about RPM-OSTree?\nOSTree is a tool to manage bootable, immutable, versioned filesystem trees. Unlike traditional package managers like rpm or dpkg that know how to install, uninstall, configure packages, OSTree has no knowledge of the relationship between files. But when you add rpm capabilities on top of OSTree, it becomes RPM-OSTree, meaning a filetree replication system that is also package-aware.The idea behind it is to use a client / server architecture to keep your Linux installed machines (physical or VM) in sync with the latest bits, in a predictable and reliable manner. To achieve that, OSTree uses a git-like repository that records the changes to any file and replicate them to any subscriber.A system administrator or an image builder developer takes a base Linux image, prepares the packages and other configuration on a server box, executes a command to compose a filetree that the host machines will download and then incrementally upgrade whenever a new change has been committed.\nYou may read more about OSTree here.\n1.2 Why use RPM-OSTree in Photon?\nThere are several important benefits:\n\nReliable, efficient: The filetree replication is simple, reliable and efficient. It will only transfer deltas over the network. If you have deployed two almost identical bootable images on same box (differing just by several files), it will not take twice the space. The new tree will have a set of hardlinks to the old tree and only the different files will have a separate copy stored to disk.\nAtomic: the filetree replication is atomic. At the end of a deployment, you are either booting from one deployment, or the other. There is no \"partial deployed bootable image\". If anything bad happens during replication or deployment- power loss, network failure, your machine boots from the old image. There is even a tool option to cleanup old deployed (successfully or not) image.\nManageable: You are provided simple tools to figure out exactly what packages have been installed, to compare files, configuration and package changes between versions.\nPredictable, repeatable: A big headache for a system administrator is to maintain a farm of computers with different packages, files and configuration installed in different order, that will result in exponential set of test cases. With RPM-OStree, you get identical, predictable installed systems. \n\nAs drawbacks, I would mention:\n\nSome applications configured by user on host may have compatibility issues if they save configuration or download into read only directories like /usr.\nPeople not used with \"read only\" file systems will be disappointed that they could no longer use RPM, yum, tdnf to install whatever they want. Think of this as an \"enterprise policy\". They may circumvent this by customizing the target directory to a writable directory like /var or using rpm to install packages and record them using a new RPM repository in a writable place.\nAdministrators need to be aware about the directories re-mapping specific to OSTree and plan accordingly.\n\n1.3 Photon with RPM-OSTree installation profiles\nPhoton takes advantage of RPM-OSTree and offers several installation choices:\n\nPhoton RPM-OSTree server - used to compose customized Photon OS installations and to prepare updates. I will call it for short 'server'.\nPhoton RPM-OSTree host connected to a default online server repository via http or https, maintained by VMware Photon OS team, where future updates will be published. This will create a minimal installation profile, but with the option to self-upgrade. I will call it for short 'default host'.\nPhoton RPM-OSTree host connected to a custom server repository. It requires a Photon RPM-OSTree Server installed in advance. I will call it for short 'custom host'.\n\n1.4 Terminology\nI use the term \"OSTree\" (starting with capitals) throughout this document, when I refer to the general use of this technology, the format of the repository or replication protocol. I use \"RPM-OSTree\" to emphasize the layer that adds RedHat Package Manager compatibility on both ends - at server and at host. However, since Photon OS is an RPM-based Linux, there are places in the documentation and even in the installer menus where \"OSTree\" may be used instead of \"RPM-OSTree\" when the distinction is not obvious or doesn't matter in that context.\nWhen \"ostree\" and \"rpm-ostree\" (in small letters) are encountered, they refer to the usage of the specific Unix commands.   \nFinally, \"Photon RPM-OSTree\" is the application or implementation of RPM-OStree system into Photon OS, materialized into two options: Photon Server and Photon Host (or client). \"Server\" or \"Host\" may be used with or without the \"Photon\" and/or \"RPM-OStree\" qualifier, but it means the same thing. \n1.5 Sample code\nCodes samples used throughout the book are small commands that can be typed at shell command prompt and do not require downloading additional files. As an alternative, one can remote via ssh, so cut & paste sample code from outside sources or copy files via scp will work. See the Photon Administration guide to learn how to enable ssh. \nThe samples assume that the following VMs have been installed - see the steps in the next chapters:\n\nA default host VM named photon-host-def.\nTwo server VMs named photon-srv1 and photon-srv2.\nTwo custom host VMs named photon-host-cus1 and photon-host-cus2, connected each to the corresponding server during install.\n\n1.6 How to read this book\nI've tried to structure this book to be used both as a sequential read and as a reference documentation.If you are just interested in deploying a host system and keeping it up to date, then read chapters 2 and 5.If you want to install your own server and experiment with customizing packages for your Photon hosts, then read chapters 6 to 9. There are references to the concepts discussed throughout the book, if you need to understand them better.However, if you want to read page by page, information is presented from simple to complex, although as with any technical book, we occasionally run into the chicken and egg problem - forward references to concepts that have yet to be explained later. In other cases, concepts are introduced and presented in great detail that may be seem hard to follow at first, but I promise they will make sense in the later pages when you get to use them.\n1.7 Difference between versions\nThis book has been written when Photon 1.0 was released, so all the information presented apply directly to Photon 1.0 and also to Photon 1.0 Revision 2 (in short Photon 1.0 Rev2 or Photon 1.0r, as some people refer to it as Photon 1.0 Refresh). This release is relevant to OSTree, because of ISO including an updated RPM-OSTree repository containing upgraded packages, as well as matching updated online repo that plays well into the upgrade story. Other than that, differences are minimal.  \nThe guide has been updated significantly for Photon OS 2.0. Information of what's different is scattered through chapters 2, 6, 7, 8. Install or rebase to Photon OS 2.0 is dedicated to the topic.    \nOSTree technology is evolving too and rather than pointing out at what package version some feature has been introduced or changed, the focus is on the ostree and rpm-ostree package versions included with the Photon OS major releases.\n"},"Photon-RPM-OSTree-2-Installing-a-host-against-default-server-repository.html":{"url":"Photon-RPM-OSTree-2-Installing-a-host-against-default-server-repository.html","title":"Installing a Photon RPM-OSTree host against default server repository","keywords":"","body":"Installing a host against default server repository\nRPM-OSTree Host default server repo installation option in Photon 1.0 or 1.0 Revision 2 will setup a profile similar to Photon Minimal, with the added benefit of being able to self-upgrade.Photon OS 2.0 does not offer a 'default host' installation. See chapter 7 and 12 for other options. \n2.1 Who is this for?\nThe RPM-OSTree 'default host' is the easiest way to deploy a Photon RPM-OSTree host from ISO/cdrom, without the need to deploy and maintain an RPM-OSTree server. It is targeted at the user who relies on VMware Photon OS team to keep his or her system up-to-date, configured to get its updates from the official Photon 1.0 OSTree repository.\nThis is also the fastest way to install a host (18 seconds on my Mac with SSD after all UI choices have been entered by user), as we've included in the ISO/cdrom an identical copy of the Photon 1.0 \"starter\" RPM-OSTree repository that is published online by VMware Photon OS team. So rather than pulling from the online repository, the installer pulls the repo from cdrom, which saves bandwidth and also reduces to zero the chances of failing due to a networking problem. After successful installation, any updates are going to be pulled from the official online repository, when Photon OS team will make them available.    \nNote: It is also possible to install an RPM-OSTree host against the official online repo via PXE boot, without the benefit of fast, local pull from cdrom. This will be covered in the PXE boot/kickstart chapter, as it requires additional configuration.\n2.2 Installing the ISO, step by step\nUser will first download Photon 1.0 ISO file or the newer Photon 1.0 Rev2 ISO file that contains the installer, which is able to deploy any of the supported Photon installation profiles.\nThere are some steps common to all Photon installation profiles, starting with adding a VM in VMware Fusion, Workstation or ESXi, selecting the OS family, then customizing for disk size, CPU, memory size, network interface etc. (or leaving the defaults) and selecting the ISO image as cdrom. The installer will launch, that will go through disk partitioning and accepting the license agreement screens, followed by selecting an installation profile.\nThese steps are described at the page linked below, so I won't repeat them, just that instead of setting up a Photon Minimal profile, we will install a Photon OSTree host:   \nRunning Project Photon on Fusion.  \nSelect the Photon OSTree Host option.\n  \nContinue with setting up a host name like photon1-def and a root password, re-confirm.Then, select \"Default OSTree Server\" and continue.  \n\n  \nWhen installation is over, the VM will reboot and will show in grub VMWare Photon/Linux 1.0_minimal (ostree), which will reassure that it's booting from an OSTree image!  \n  \nBoot, login and you are ready to use it!  The next chapters are about experimenting first hand and understanding in detail how everything works. If you just want to learn how to upgrade your host when new updates are available, skip to Host updating operations.\nNote: If you ran Photon 1.0 Rev2 installer rather than Photon 1.0, you may notice in grub 1.0_minimal.1 rather than 1.0_minimal, hinting of an updated, newer version installed. This will be also explained in Host updating operations.  \n"},"Photon-RPM-OStree-3-Concepts-in-action.html":{"url":"Photon-RPM-OStree-3-Concepts-in-action.html","title":"Concepts in action","keywords":"","body":"Concepts in Action\nNow that we have a fresh installed host (either as [[default|Photon-RPM-OSTree:-2-Installing-a-host-against-default-server-repository]] or [[custom|Photon-RPM-OSTree:-7-Installing-a-host-against-a-custom-server-repository]]), I can explain better the OStree concepts and see them in action.  \n3.1 Querying the deployed filetrees\nThe first thing to do is to run a command that tells us what is installed on the machine and when. Since it's a fresh install from the CD, there is only one bootable filetree image deployed.\nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree status\n  TIMESTAMP (UTC)       VERSION       ID           OSNAME  REFSPEC               \n* 2016-06-07 14:06:17   1.0_minimal   56ef687f13   photon  photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\n3.2 Bootable filetree version\n1.0_minimal is not the Linux Photon OS release version, nor daily build, but rather a human readable, self-incrementing version associated with every commit that brings file/package updates. Think of this as version 0. The following versions are going to be 1.0_minimal.1, 1.0_minimal.2, 1.0_minimal.3 and so on.\n3.3 Commit ID\nThe ID listed is actually the first 5 bytes (10 hex digits) of the commit hash. If you want to see the entire 32 bytes hex number, just add the 'pretty' formatting option. The .0 at the end means that this is the default bootable deployment. This will change to 1 when another deployment will take its place as the default.\nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree status -p\n============================================================\n  * DEFAULT ON BOOT\n----------------------------------------\n  version    1.0_minimal\n  timestamp  2016-06-07 14:06:17\n  id         56ef687f1319604b7900a232715718d26ca407de7e1dc89251b206f8e255dcb4.0\n  osname     photon     \n  refspec    photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\n============================================================\n3.4 OSname\nThe OS Name identifies the operating system installed. All bootable filetrees for the same OS will share the /var directory, in other words applications installed in one booted image into this directory will be available in all other images.If a new set of images are created for a different OS, they will receive a fresh copy of /var that is not shared with the previous OS images for the initial OS. In other words, if a machine is dual boot for different operating systems, they will not share each other's /var content, however they will still merge 3-way /etc.\n3.5 Refspec\nThe Refspec is a branch inside the repo, expressed in a hierarchical way. In this case, it's the default branch that will receive package updates for the Photon OS 1.0 Minimal installation profile on Intel platforms. There could be other branches in the future, for example photon/1.0/x86_64/full that will match the Full installation profile (full set of packages installed).Think of Refspec as the head of the minimal branch (just like in git) at the origin repo. On the replicated, local repo at the host, minimal is a file that contains the latest commit ID known for that branch.  \nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# cat /ostree/repo/refs/remotes/photon/photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal \n56ef687f1319604b7900a232715718d26ca407de7e1dc89251b206f8e255dcb4\nWhy are there two 'photon' directory levels in the remotes path? The photon: prefix in the Refspec listed by rpm-ostree status corresponds to the first photon directory in the remotes path and is actually the name given to the remote that the host is connected to, which points to an http or https URL. We'll talk about remotes later, but for now think of it as a namespace qualifier.  The second photon is part of the Refspec path itself.\n3.6 Deployments\nWe've used so far rpm-ostree. The same information can be obtained running an ostree command:\nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# ostree admin status\n* photon 56ef687f1319604b7900a232715718d26ca407de7e1dc89251b206f8e255dcb4.0\n    Version: 1.0_minimal\n    origin refspec: photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\nBut where is this information stored? As you may have guessed, the local repo stores the heads of the deployed trees - the most recent commitment ID, just like Git does:  \nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# cat /ostree/repo/refs/heads/ostree/0/1/0 \n56ef687f1319604b7900a232715718d26ca407de7e1dc89251b206f8e255dcb4\nThis also where this command that lists the references (local heads and remotes) takes its data from:\nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# ostree refs\nphoton:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\nostree/0/1/0\nBased on that, it could find the root of the deployment that it boots from. The actual filetree is deployed right here:\nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# ls -l /ostree/deploy/photon/deploy/56ef687f1319604b7900a232715718d26ca407de7e1dc89251b206f8e255dcb4.0\ntotal 36\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    7 Jun  9 18:26 bin -> usr/bin\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 boot\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 dev\ndrwxr-xr-x 33 root root 4096 Jun 12 23:04 etc\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    8 Jun  9 18:26 home -> var/home\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    7 Jun  9 18:26 lib -> usr/lib\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    7 Jun  9 18:26 lib64 -> usr/lib\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    9 Jun  9 18:26 media -> run/media\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    7 Jun  9 18:26 mnt -> var/mnt\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    7 Jun  9 18:26 opt -> var/opt\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   14 Jun  9 18:26 ostree -> sysroot/ostree\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 proc\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   12 Jun  9 18:26 root -> var/roothome\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 run\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    8 Jun  9 18:26 sbin -> usr/sbin\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    7 Jun  9 18:26 srv -> var/srv\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 sys\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 sysroot\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   11 Jun  9 18:26 tmp -> sysroot/tmp\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 usr\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 var\nSo how is a deployment linked to a specific branch, originating from a remote repo? Well, there is a file next to the deployed filetree root directory with the same name and .origin suffix, that contains exactly this info:\nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# cat /ostree/deploy/photon/deploy/56ef687f1319604b7900a232715718d26ca407de7e1dc89251b206f8e255dcb4.0.origin \n[origin]\nrefspec=photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\nFast forwarding a bit, if there is a new deployment due to an upgrade or rebase, a new filetree will be added at the same level, and a new .origin file will tie it to the remote branch it originated from.  \nThe photon directory in the path is the actual OSname. Multiple deployments of same OS will share a writable /var folder.  \nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# ls -l /ostree/deploy/photon/var/\ntotal 52\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 cache\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 home\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 lib\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 local\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   11 Jun  9 18:26 lock -> ../run/lock\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 log\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 mail\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 mnt\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 opt\ndrwx------  2 root root 4096 Jun 12 23:06 roothome\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    6 Jun  9 18:26 run -> ../run\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 spool\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 srv\ndrwxrwxrwt  4 root root 4096 Jun 12 23:04 tmp\ndrwxr-xr-x 11 root root 4096 Jun  9 18:26 usrlocal\n"},"Photon-RPM-OSTree-4-Querying-for-commit-file-and-package-metadata.html":{"url":"Photon-RPM-OSTree-4-Querying-for-commit-file-and-package-metadata.html","title":"Querying for commit, file and package metadata","keywords":"","body":"Querying For Commit File and Package Metadata\nThere are several ostree and rpm-ostree commands that list file or package data based on either the Commit ID, or Refspec.

But what if you want to erase or install a package using our old friend rpm?\nThe RPM database is not writable any longer and the file system itself is read-only (except for /var and /etc directories). The idea is that preparing the packages should be done via server tree composition and deployment at host should bring them installed into a new bootable tree that is read-only, recorded into the read-only RPM database. This will insure that all systems deployed are brought into a predictable state and no one could mess with them.\nIn fact, tdnf and yum commands are not even available to install new packages at the host. Even if you bring them over, adding a new package via tdnf install will return an error.\nBut don't get sad. Installing, updating and deleting files & packages the RPM-OSTree way - from the server - that's exactly the topic of next chapters.\n"},"Photon-RPM-OSTree-5-Host-updating-operations.html":{"url":"Photon-RPM-OSTree-5-Host-updating-operations.html","title":"Host updating operations","keywords":"","body":"Host Updating Operations\n5.1 Is it an update or an upgrade?\nIf you've used yum, dnf (and now tdnf for Photon) in RPM systems or apt-get in Debian based Unix, you understand what \"install\" is for packages and the subtle difference between \"update\" and \"upgrade\".\nOSTree and RPM-OSTree don't distringuish between them and the term \"upgrade\" has a slightly different meaning - to bring the system in sync with the remote repo, to the top of the Refspec (branch), just like in Git, by pulling the latest changes.\nIn fact, ostree and rpm-ostree commands support a single \"upgrade\" verb for a file image tree and a package list in the same refspec (branch). rpm-ostree upgrade will install a package if it doesn't exist, will not touch it if it has same version in the new image, will upgrade it if the version number is higher and it may actually downgrade it, if the package has been downgraded in the new image. I wish this operation had a different name, to avoid any confusion.\nThe reverse operation of an upgrade is a \"rollback\" and fortunately it's not named \"downgrade\" because it may upgrade packages in the last case describe above.\nAs we'll see in a future chapter, a jump to a different Refspec (branch) is also supported and it's named \"rebase\".\n5.2 Incremental upgrade\nTo check if there are any updates available, one would execute:\nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree upgrade\nUpdating from: photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\n\n\nNo upgrade available.\nIt's good idea to check periodically for updates. In fact, VMware released in July 2016 Photon OS 1.0 Revision 2, that included an ISO containing an updated OSTree repo, mirrored online at same bintray site location. The updated OSTree repo contains new versions all packages that have been updated between since the 1.0 GA (general availability) in September 2015.  \nTo simplify our example, let's assume that an updated Photon OS release for this branch (Refspec) contains three new packages: gawk, sudo and wget.\nTo check if there are any new updates without actually applying them, we will pass the --check-diff flag, that would list the different packages as added, modified or deleted - if such operations were to happen.\nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree upgrade --check-diff\nUpdating from: photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\n\n8 metadata, 13 content objects fetched; 1026 KiB transferred in 0 seconds\n+gawk-4.1.3-2.ph1.x86_64\n+sudo-1.8.15-3.ph1.x86_64\n+wget-1.17.1-2.ph1.x86_64\nWe like what we see and now let's upgrade for real. This command will deploy a new bootable filetree. \nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree upgrade             \nUpdating from: photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\n\n98 metadata, 189 content objects fetched; 14418 KiB transferred in 0 seconds\nCopying /etc changes: 6 modified, 0 removed, 16 added\nTransaction complete; bootconfig swap: yes deployment count change: 1\nAdded:\n  gawk-4.1.3-2.ph1.x86_64\n  sudo-1.8.15-3.ph1.x86_64\n  wget-1.17.1-2.ph1.x86_64\nUpgrade prepared for next boot; run \"systemctl reboot\" to start a reboot\nBy looking at the commit history, notice that the new commit has the original commit as parent. \nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# ostree log photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\ncommit 184d9bbcecd4e8401d4a5073a248082f7a8888d232ef9678b6942002547a14e3\nDate:  2016-06-13 22:23:25 +0000\nVersion: 1.0_minimal.1\n\n\ncommit 56ef687f1319604b7900a232715718d26ca407de7e1dc89251b206f8e255dcb4\nDate:  2016-06-07 14:06:17 +0000\nVersion: 1.0_minimal\nNotice that now we have a new reference, that corresponds to the newly deployed image.\nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# ostree refs\nostree/1/1/0\nostree/1/1/1\nphoton:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\nLet's look at the status. The new filetree version .1 has the expected Commit ID and a newer timestamp, that is actually the server date/time when the image has been generated, not the time/date when it was downloaded or installed at the host. The old image has a star next to it, showing that's the image the system is booted currently into. \nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree status\n  TIMESTAMP (UTC)        VERSION          ID            OSNAME    REFSPEC                              \n  2016-06-13 22:23:25    1.0_minimal.1    184d9bbcec    photon    photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal     \n* 2016-06-07 14:06:17    1.0_minimal      56ef687f13    photon    photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\nNow let's type 'reboot'. Grub will list the new filetree as the first image, marked with a star, as the default bootable image. If the keyboard is not touched and order is not changed, grub will timeout and will boot into that image.\n\nLet's look again at the status. It's identical, just that the star is next to the newer image, to show it's the current image it has booted from.\nroot@photon-host [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree status\n  TIMESTAMP (UTC)        VERSION          ID            OSNAME    REFSPEC                              \n* 2016-06-13 22:23:25    1.0_minimal.1    184d9bbcec    photon    photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal     \n  2016-06-07 14:06:17    1.0_minimal      56ef687f13    photon    photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\nAlso, the current deployment directory is based on the new 82bca commit:\nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# ostree admin config-diff --print-current-dir\n/ostree/deploy/photon/deploy/82bca728eadb7292d568404484ad6889c3f6303600ca8c743a4336e0a10b3817.0\nA fresh upgrade for a new version will delete the older, original image and bring a new one, that will become the new default image. The previous 'default' image will move down one position as the backup image.\n5.3 Listing file differences\nNow we can look at what files have been Added, Modified, Deleted due to the addition of those three packages and switching of the boot directories, by comparing the two commits.\nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# ostree diff 2940 82bc\nM    /usr/etc/group-\nM    /usr/etc/gshadow\nM

go back to the previous image, we can rollback. The order of the images will be changed, so the old filetree will become the default bootable image. If -r option is passed, the rollback will continue with a reboot.\nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree rollback\nMoving '2940e10c4d90ce6da572cbaeeff7b511cab4a64c280bd5969333dd2fca57cfa8.0' to be first deployment\nTransaction complete; bootconfig swap: yes deployment count change: 0\nRemoved:\n  gawk-4.1.0-2.ph1.x86_64\n  sudo-1.8.11p1-4.ph1.x86_64\n  wget-1.15-1.ph1.x86_64\nSuccessfully reset deployment order; run \"systemctl reboot\" to start a reboot\nIn fact, we can repeat the rollback operation as many times as we want before reboot. On each execution, it's going to change the order. It will not delete any image.However, an upgrade will keep the current default image and will eliminate the other image, whichever that is.

You won't need to do that normally, as upgrading to a new image will delete the old one, but if for some reason deploying failed (loss of power, networking issues), you'll want to delete the partially deployed image.The only supported index is 1. (If multiple bootable images will be supported in the future, a larger than one, zero-based index of the image to delete will be supported).You cannot delete the default bootable filetree, so passing 0 will result in an error.  \nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# ostree admin undeploy -v 1\nOT: Using bootloader: OstreeBootloaderGrub2\nTransaction complete; bootconfig swap: yes deployment count change: -1\nDeleted deployment 82bca728eadb7292d568404484ad6889c3f6303600ca8c743a4336e0a10b3817.0\n\nroot@photon-host-cus1 [ ~ ]# ostree admin undeploy -v 0\nerror: Cannot undeploy currently booted deployment 0\nNow, we can see that the newer image is gone, the deployment directory for commit 82bc has been removed.  \nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree status\n  TIMESTAMP (UTC)        VERSION        ID            OSNAME    REFSPEC                              \n* 2015-08-20 22:27:43    1.0_minimal    2940e10c4d    photon    photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal \nroot@photon-host-cus1 [ ~ ]# ls /ostree/deploy/photon/deploy/                                        \n2940e10c4d90ce6da572cbaeeff7b511cab4a64c280bd5969333dd2fca57cfa8.0\n2940e10c4d90ce6da572cbaeeff7b511cab4a64c280bd5969333dd2fca57cfa8.0.origin\nHowever the commit is still there in the OSTree repo.\nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# ostree log 82bc                 \ncommit 82bca728eadb7292d568404484ad6889c3f6303600ca8c743a4336e0a10b3817\nDate:  2015-09-03 00:34:41 +0000\nVersion: 1.0_minimal.1\n\n\ncommit 2940e10c4d90ce6da572cbaeeff7b511cab4a64c280bd5969333dd2fca57cfa8\nDate:  2015-08-20 22:27:43 +0000\nVersion: 1.0_minimal\nBut there is nothing to rollback to.\nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree rollback\nerror: Found 1 deployments, at least 2 required for rollback\nIf we were to upgrade again, it would bring these packages back, but let's just check the differeneces.\nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree upgrade --check-diff\nUpdating from: photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\n\n\n+gawk-4.1.0-2.ph1.x86_64\n+sudo-1.8.11p1-4.ph1.x86_64\n+wget-1.15-1.ph1.x86_64\n5.7 Version skipping upgrade\nLet's assume that after a while, VMware releases version 2 that removes sudo and adds bison and tar.

Installation took about 40 seconds for Fusion running on my Mac with SSD, but it should take longer time for spin hard drives.  \nFor Photon 1.0, once the server boots, the RPM-OSTree repository is ready to accept pull request from hosts, because setting up a 'minimal' tree is part of installation. This ostree 'minimal' configuration is almost identical, as far as packages list, to the 'Photon Minimal' installation profile from 'Select Installation' menu. \n\nIn order for hosts to access server's OSTree repo via http, an Apache web server is configured as part of installation. If you want to also serve https, you need to take additional steps - configure the web server, open port 443 via iptables and install certificates specific to your organization, that I won't cover here.  \nThe server's IP address will be passed to the Photon RPM-OSTree hosts that want to connect to this server.You may ask your network administrator for a static IP, registered to your company's DNS, so your users who install Photon RPM-OSTree hosts will enter a pretty name like http://photon-srv.yourcompany.com, rather than remember a numeric IP address.\nHaving the server configured, you may advance to next chapter to install your own host from this server's repository. That's a way to verify right away that all components (server, network) are running correctly and test the 'minimal' server filetree image by downloading and installing it at the host.\n6.2 Composing your first OSTree repo\nIf you've installed Photon 2.0 OSTree server, the server did not setup a tree as part of an installation, but configuration files for starter 'base', 'minimal' and 'full' tree are there for you. To create a 'minimal' tree, you only need two commands - one to initialize a new repo, the other one to compose it.\nroot [ ~ ]# cd /srv/rpm-ostree\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# ostree --repo=repo init --mode=archive-z2\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# rpm-ostree compose tree --repo=repo photon-base.json\nYou are now ready to deploy a host, explained in next chapter. Skip to Chapter 8: File oriented server operations and Chapter 9: Package oriented server operations to learn create your own customized file tree.   \n6.2 Automated install of a server via kickstart\nAll Photon OS versions support unattended install, in other words installer will display its progress, but will not prompt for any keys to be clicked, and will boot at the end of installation. This will create an identical server as installing via UI.\nIf not familiar with the way kickstart works, visit Kickstart Support in Photon OS. The kickstart json config for OSTree is similar to minimal or full, except for this setting:  \n\"type\": \"ostree_server\"\n"},"Photon-RPM-OSTree-7-Installing-a-host-against-a-custom-server-repository.html":{"url":"Photon-RPM-OSTree-7-Installing-a-host-against-a-custom-server-repository.html","title":"Installing a Photon RPM-OStree host against a custom server repository","keywords":"","body":"Installing a Photon RPM-OStree host against a custom server repository\nOrganizations that maintain their own OSTree servers create custom image trees suited to their needs from which hosts can be deployed and upgraded. One single server may make available several branches to install, for example \"base\", \"minimal\" and \"full\". Or, if you think in terms of Windows OS SKUs - \"Home\", \"Professional\" or \"Enterprise\" edition.\nSo in fact there are two pieces of information the OSTree host installer needs - the server URL and the branch ref. Also, there are two ways to pass this info - manually via keyboard, when prompted and automated, by reading from a config file.\n7.1 Manual install of a custom host\nFor Photon 1.0 or 1.0 Revision 2, installing a Photon RPM-OSTree host that will pull from a server repository of your choice is very similar to the way we installed the host against the default server repo in Chapter 2.We will follow the same steps, selecting \"Photon OSTree Host\", and after assigning a host name like photon-host and a root password, this time we will click on \"Custom RPM-OSTree Server\".  \n\nAn additional screen will ask for the URL of server repo - just enter the IP address or fully qualified domain name of the server installed in the previous step.  \n\nYou will then be asked to enter a Refspec. Leave the default 'photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal' value, unless you've created a new branch at the server (we will see later how to do that).  \n\nOnce this is done and the installation finished, reboot and you are ready to use it.You may verify - just like in Chapter 3.1 - that you can get an rpm-ostree status. The value for the CommitID should be identical to the host that installed from default repo, if the server has been installed fresh, from the same ISO.  \nPhoton 2.0 does not provide the UI option to install an RPM-OSTree host, but supports automated, UI-less install, that we'll explore next.\n7.2 Automated install of a custom host via kickstart\nPhoton 1.0, 1.0 Revision 2 and Photon OS 2.0 support automated install that will not interact with the user, in other words installer will display its progress, but will not prompt for any keys to be clicked, and will boot at the end of installation.  \nIf not familiar with the way kickstart works, visit Kickstart Support in Photon OS. The kickstart json config for OSTree is similar to minimal or full, except for these settings that should sound familiar: \n    ...\n    \"type\": \"ostree_host\",\n    \"ostree_repo_url\": \"http://192.168.218.249\",\n    \"ostree_repo_ref\": \"photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\",\n    ...\nIf the server is Photon OS 2.0, and the administrator composed trees for the included json files, the ostree_repo_ref will take either value: photon/2.0/x86_64/base, photon/2.0/x86_64/minimal, or photon/2.0/x86_64/full.\nIn most situations, kickstart file is accessed via http from PXE boot. That enables booting from network and end to end install of hosts from pre-defined server URL and branch without assistance from user. \n"},"Photon-RPM-OStree-8-File-oriented-server-operations.html":{"url":"Photon-RPM-OStree-8-File-oriented-server-operations.html","title":"File oriented server operations","keywords":"","body":"File Oriented Server Operations\nIn this chapter, we will checkout a filetree into a writable directory structure on disk, make several file changes and commit the changes back into the repository. Then we will download this commit and apply at the host. As you may have guessed, this chapter is mostly about OSTree - the base technology. I've not mentioned anything about packages, although it is quite possible to install packages (afler all, packages are made of files, right?) and commit without the help of rpm-ostree, but it's too much of a headache and not worth the effort, since rpm-ostree does it simpler and better.  \nWhen would you want to do that? When you want for all your hosts to get an application or configuration customization that is not encapsulated as part of a package upgrade.\n8.1 Starting a fresh OSTree repo\nIf you want to start fresh with your own branch and/or versioning scheme, you can delete the OSTree repo created during the Photon 1.0 RPM-OSTree server install and re-create it empty.

To create a summary, run this command after you committed for your branches:\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# ostree summary -u \"This is BigData's OSTree server, it has three branches\"\nWe will find out later how the hosts query for branches list. \n"},"Photon-RPM-OSTree-9-Package-oriented-server-operations.html":{"url":"Photon-RPM-OSTree-9-Package-oriented-server-operations.html","title":"Package oriented server operations","keywords":"","body":"Package Oriented Server Operations\nNow that we have a Photon RPM-OSTree server up and running (if not, see how to install), we will learn how to provide the desired set of packages as input and instruct rpm-ostree to compose a filetree, that will result in creation (or update) of an OSTree repo.The simplest way to explain is to take a look at the files installed by the Photon RPM-OSTree server during setup.  \nroot [ ~ ]# cd /srv/rpm-ostree/\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# ls -l\ntotal 16\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   31 Aug 28 19:06 lightwave-ostree.repo -> /etc/yum.repos.d/lightwave.repo\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7356 Aug 28 19:06 ostree-httpd.conf\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1085 Aug 28 19:06 photon-base.json\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   35 Aug 28 19:06 photon-extras-ostree.repo -> /etc/yum.repos.d/photon-extras.repo\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   32 Aug 28 19:06 photon-iso-ostree.repo -> /etc/yum.repos.d/photon-iso.repo\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   28 Aug 28 19:06 photon-ostree.repo -> /etc/yum.repos.d/photon.repo\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   36 Aug 28 19:06 photon-updates-ostree.repo -> /etc/yum.repos.d/photon-updates.repo\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root 4096 Aug 20 22:27 repo\n9.1 JSON configuration file\nHow can we tell rpm-ostree what packages we want to include, where to get them from and how to compose the filetree? There is JSON file for that. Let's take a look at photon-base.json used by the Photon OS team.  \nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# cat photon-base.json \n{\n    \"comment\": \"Photon Minimal OSTree\",\n\n    \"osname\": \"photon\",\n\n    \"ref\": \"photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\",\n\n    \"automatic_version_prefix\": \"1.0_minimal\",\n\n    \"repos\": [\"photon\"],\n\n    \"selinux\": false,\n\n    \"initramfs-args\": [\"--no-hostonly\"],\n\n    \"bootstrap_packages\": [\"filesystem\"],\n\n    \"packages\": [\"glibc\", \"zlib\", \"binutils\", \"gmp\", \"mpfr\", \"libgcc\", \"libstdc++\",\"libgomp\",\n                \"pkg-config\", \"ncurses\", \"bash\", \"bzip2\", \"cracklib\", \"cracklib-dicts\", \"shadow\",\n                \"procps-ng\", \"iana-etc\", \"readline\", \"coreutils\", \"bc\", \"libtool\", \"inetutils\",\n                \"findutils\", \"xz\", \"grub2\", \"iproute2\", \"util-linux\", \"linux\",\n                \"attr\", \"libcap\", \"kmod\", \"expat\", \"dbus\", \"file\",\n                \"sed\", \"grep\", \"cpio\", \"gzip\",\n                \"openssl\", \"ca-certificates\", \"curl\",\n                \"systemd\",\n                \"openssh\", \"iptables\",\n                \"photon-release\",\n                \"vim\", \"tdnf\",\n                \"docker\",\"bridge-utils\",\n                \"dracut\", \"dracut-tools\", \"rpm-ostree\", \"nss-altfiles\", \"which\"]\n}\nThere are some mandatory settings, some optional. I'm only going to explain the most important ones for our use case.osname and ref should be familiar, they have been explained in previous sections OSname and Refspec. Basicaly, we are asking rpm-ostree to compose a tree for photon OS and photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal branch.\n9.2 Package addition, removal, upgrade\npackages is the list of packages that are to be added, in this case, in the \"minimal\" installation profile, on top of the packages already included by default. This is not quite the identical set of RPMS you get when you select the minimal profile in the ISO installer, but it's pretty close and that's why it's been named the same. \nLet's add to the list three new packages: gawk, sudo and wget using vim photon-base.json\n!!!Warning: do not remove any packages from the default list, even an \"innocent\" one, as it may bring the system to an unstable condition.  During my testing, I've removed \"which\"; it turns out it was used to figure out the grub booting roots: on reboot, the system was left hanging at grub prompt.\n9.3 RPMS repository\nBut where are these packages located? RPM-OStree uses the same standard RPMS repositories, that yum installs from.\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# ls /etc/yum.repos.d/\nlightwave.repo  photon-iso.repo  photon-updates.repo  photon.repo\nGoing back to our JSON file, repos is a multi-value setting that tells RPM-OSTree in what RPMS repositories to look for packages. In this case, it looks in the current directory for a \"photon\" repo configuration file, that is a .repo file starting with a [photon] section. There is such a file: photon-ostree.repo, that is in fact a link to photon.repo in /etc/yum.repos.d directory.\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# cat /etc/yum.repos.d/photon.repo \n[photon]\nname=VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)\nbaseurl=https://dl.bintray.com/vmware/photon_release_1.0_x86_64\ngpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/VMWARE-RPM-GPG-KEY\ngpgcheck=1\nenabled=1\nskip_if_unavailable=True\nIn this case, rpm-ostree is instructed to download its packages in RPM format from the bintray URL, that is the location of an online RPMS repo maintained by the WMware Photon OS team. To make sure those packages are genuine, signed by VMware, the signature is checked against the official VMware public key.\nSo what's in an RPMS repository? If we point the browser to https://dl.bintray.com/vmware/photon_release_1.0_x86_64, we can see there are three top directories:\n\nnoarch - where all packages that don't depend on the architecture reside. Those may contain scripts, platform neutral source files, configuration.\nx86_64 - platform dependent packages for Intel 32 and 64 bits CPUs.\nrepodata - internal repo management data, like a catalog of all packages, and for every package its name, id, version, architecture and full path file/directory list. There is also a compressed XML file containing the history of changelogs extracted from github, as packages in RPM format were built by Photon OS team members from sources.\n\nFortunately, in order to compose a tree, you don't need to download the packages from the online repository (which is time consuming - in the order of minutes), unless there are some new ones or updated versions of them, added by the Photon team after shipping 1.0 version or the 1.0 Refresh. A copy of the starter RPMS repository (as of 1.0 shipping date) has been included on the CD-ROM and you can access it.\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# mount /dev/cdrom\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# ls /mnt/cdrom/RPMS\nnoarch  repodata  x86_64\nAll you have to do now is to replace the \"repos\": [\"photon\"] entry by \"repos\": [\"photon-iso\"], which will point to the RPMS repo on CD-ROM, rather than the online repo.

You can force however to redo the whole composition.\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# rpm-ostree compose tree --repo=repo photon-base.json\nPrevious commit: c505f4bddb4381e8b5213682465f1e5bb150a18228aa207d763cea45c6a81bbe\n\nDownloading metadata [=========================================================================] 100%\n\n\nNo apparent changes since previous commit; use --force-nocache to override\nThis takes several minutes. Then why is the RPM-OSTree server installing so fast, in 45 seconds on my SSD? The server doesn't compose the tree, it uses a pre-created OSTree repo that is stored on the CD-ROM. It comes of course at the expense of larger CD-ROM size. This OSTree repo is created from the same set of RPMS on the CD-ROM, so if you compose fresh, you will get the same exact tree, with same commit ID for the \"minimal\" ref. \n9.5 Automatic version prefix\nIf you recall the filetree version explained earlier, this is where it comes into play. When a tree is composed from scratch, the first version (0) associated to the initial commit is going to get that human readable value. Any subsequent compose operation will auto-increment to .1, .2, .3 and so on.It's a good idea to start a versionning scheme of your own, so that your customized Photon builds that may get different packages of your choice don't get the same version numbers as the official Photon team builds, coming from VMware's bintray OSTree repository. There is no conflict, it's just confusing to have same name for different commits coming from different repos!So if you work for a company named Big Data Inc., you may want to switch to a new versioning scheme \"automatic_version_prefix\": \"1.0_bigdata\".\n9.6 Installing package updates\nIf you want to provide hosts with the package updates that VMware periodically releases, all that you need to do is to add the photon-updates.repo to the list of repos in photon-base.json and then re-compose the usual way. \n\"repos\": [\"photon\", \"photon-updates\"],\nEven though you may have not modified the \"packages\" section in the json file, the newer versions of existing packages will be included in the new image and then downloaded by the host the usual way. Note that upgrading a package shows differently than adding (+) or removing (-). You may still see packages added (or removed) though because they are new dependencies (or no longer dependencies) for the newer versions of other packages, as libssh2 in the example below.\nroot [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree upgrade --check-diff\nUpdating from: photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\n\n8 metadata, 13 content objects fetched; 1002 KiB transferred in 0 seconds\n!bridge-utils-1.5-2.ph1.x86_64\n=bridge-utils-1.5-3.ph1.x86_64\n!bzip2-1.0.6-5.ph1.x86_64\n=bzip2-1.0.6-6.ph1.x86_64\n!curl-7.47.1-2.ph1.x86_64\n=curl-7.51.0-2.ph1.x86_64\n!docker-1.11.0-5.ph1.x86_64\n=docker-1.12.1-1.ph1.x86_64\n...\n+libssh2-1.8.0-1.ph1.x86_64\n...\n\nroot [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree upgrade             \nUpdating from: photon:photon/1.0/x86_64/minimal\n\n258 metadata, 1165 content objects fetched; 76893 KiB transferred in 8 seconds\nCopying /etc changes: 6 modified, 0 removed, 14 added\nTransaction complete; bootconfig swap: yes deployment count change: 1\nChanged:\n  bridge-utils 1.5-2.ph1 -> 1.5-3.ph1\n  bzip2 1.0.6-5.ph1 -> 1.0.6-6.ph1\n  curl 7.47.1-2.ph1 -> 7.51.0-2.ph1\n  docker 1.11.0-5.ph1 -> 1.12.1-1.ph1\n  ...\nAdded:\n  libssh2-1.8.0-1.ph1.x86_64\nUpgrade prepared for next boot; run \"systemctl reboot\" to start a reboot\nNow if we want to see what packages have been updated and what issues have been fixed, just run at the host the command that we learned about in chapter 5.4.\nroot [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree db diff 56ef 396e\nostree diff commit old: 56e (56ef687f1319604b7900a232715718d26ca407de7e1dc89251b206f8e255dcb4)\nostree diff commit new: 396 (396e1116ad94692b8c105edaee4fa12447ec3d8f73c7b3ade4e955163d517497)\nUpgraded:\n bridge-utils-1.5-3.ph1.x86_64\n* Mon Sep 12 2016 Alexey Makhalov  1.5-3\n-    Update patch to fix-2.\n\n bzip2-1.0.6-6.ph1.x86_64\n* Fri Oct 21 2016 Kumar Kaushik  1.0.6-6\n-       Fixing security bug CVE-2016-3189.\n\n curl-7.51.0-2.ph1.x86_64\n* Wed Nov 30 2016 Xiaolin Li  7.51.0-2\n-   Enable sftp support.\n\n* Wed Nov 02 2016 Anish Swaminathan  7.51.0-1\n-       Upgrade curl to 7.51.0\n\n* Thu Oct 27 2016 Anish Swaminathan  7.47.1-4\n-       Patch for CVE-2016-5421\n\n* Mon Sep 19 2016 Xiaolin Li  7.47.1-3\n-       Applied CVE-2016-7167.patch.\n\n docker-1.12.1-1.ph1.x86_64\n* Wed Sep 21 2016 Xiaolin Li  1.12.1-1\n-   Upgraded to version 1.12.1\n\n* Mon Aug 22 2016 Alexey Makhalov  1.12.0-2\n-   Added bash completion file\n\n* Tue Aug 09 2016 Anish Swaminathan  1.12.0-1\n-   Upgraded to version 1.12.0\n\n* Tue Jun 28 2016 Anish Swaminathan  1.11.2-1\n-   Upgraded to version 1.11.2\n...\nAdded:\n libssh2-1.8.0-1.ph1.x86_64\n9.7 Composing for a different branch\nRPM-OSTree makes it very easy to create and update new branches, by composing using json config files that include the Refspec as the new branch name, the list of packages and the other settings we are now familiar with.  Photon OS 2.0 RPM-OSTRee Server installer adds two extra files photon-minimal.json and photon-full.json in addition to photon-base.json, that correspond almost identically to the minimal and full profiles installed via tdnf. It also makes 'photon-base' a smaller set of starter branch.Of course, you can create your own config files for your branches with desired lists of packages. You may compose on top of the existing tree, or you can start fresh your own OSTRee repo, using your own customized versioning.\n"},"Photon-RPM-OSTree-10-Remotes.html":{"url":"Photon-RPM-OSTree-10-Remotes.html","title":"Remotes","keywords":"","body":"Remotes\nIn Chapter 3 we talked about the Refspec that contains a photon: prefix, that is the name of a remote. When a Photon host is installed, a remote is added - which contains the URL for an OSTree repository that is the origin of the commits we are going to pull from and deploy filetrees, in our case the Photon RPM-OSTree server we installed the host from. This remote is named photon, which may be confusing, because it's also the OS name and part of the Refspec (branch) path.\n10.1 Listing remotes\nA host repo can be configured to switch between multiple remotes to pull from, however only one remote is the \"active\" one at a time. We can list the remotes created so far, which brings back the expected result.\nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# ostree remote list\nphoton\nWe can inquiry about the URL for that remote name, which for the default host is the expected Photon OS online OSTree repo.\nroot@photon-host-def [ ~ ]# ostree remote show-url photon\nhttps://dl.bintray.com/vmware/photon/rpm-ostree/1.0\nBut where is this information stored?

This will instruct any host update to skip the signing verification for the updates that come from server, resulted from tree composed locally at the server, as they are not signed. Without this, host updating will fail.  \nThere is a whole chapter about signing, importing keys and so on that I will not get into, but the idea is that signing adds an extra layer of security, by validating that everything you download comes from the trusted publisher and has not been altered. That is the case for all Photon OS artifacts downloaded from VMware official site. All OVAs and packages, either from the online RPMS repositories or included in the ISO file - are signed by VMware. We've seen a similar setting gpgcheck=1 in the RPMS repo configuration files that tdnf uses to validate or not the signature for all packages downloaded to be installed.\n10.3 Switching repositories\nSince mapping name/url is stored in the repo's config file, in principle you can re-assign a different URL, connecting the host to a different server. The next upgrade will get the latest commit chain from the new server.If we edit photon-host-def's repo config and replace the bintray URL by photon-srv1's IP address, all original packages in the original 1.0_minimal version will be preserved, but any new package change (addition, removal, upgrade) added after that (in 1.0_minimal.1, 1.0_minimal.2) will be reverted and all new commits from photon-srv1 (that may have same version) will be applied. This is because the two repos are identical copies, so they have the same original commit ID as a common ancestor, but they diverge from there.This may create confusion and it's one of the reasons I insisted on creating your own scheme of versioning.\nIf the old and new repo have nothing in common (no common ancestor commit), this will undo even the original commit, so all commits from the new tree will be applied.A better solution would be to add a new remote that will identify where the commits come from.\n10.4 Adding and removing remotes\nA cleaner way to switch repositories is to add remotes that point to different servers. Let's add another server that we will refer to as photon2, along with (optional) the refspecs for branches that it provides (we will see later that in the newer OSTree versions, we don't need to know the branch names, they could be queried at run-time). The 'minimal' and 'full' branch ref names containing '2.0' suggest this may be a Photon OS 2.0 RPM-OSTree server. \nroot@photon-host-cus [ ~ ]# ostree remote add --repo=/ostree/repo -v --no-gpg-verify photon2 http://10.118.101.86 photon/2.0/x86_64/minimal photon/2.0/x86_64/full\nroot@photon-host-cus [ ~ ]# ostree remote list\nphoton\nphoton2\nroot@photon-host-cus [ ~ ]# ostree remote show-url photon2\nhttp://10.118.101.86\nWhere is this information stored?

In git, you would run git remote show origin or git remote -a (although last command would not show all branches, unless you ran git fetch first).  \nFortunately, in Photon OS 2.0 and higher, the hosts are able to query the server, if summary metadata has been generated, as we've seen in 8.5.

To keep the ISO at reasonable size, Photon OS 2.0 no longer includes the compressed ostree.repo file, that helped optimize both the server and host install in 1.0 or 1.0 Rev2. That decision affected the OSTree features we ship out of the box. Customer could achieve the same results by several additional simple steps, that will be explained in this chapter. In addition, there is a new way to create a host raw image at server.\n12.1 Installing an RPM-OSTree server\nPhoton OS 2.0 installer contains an option to install an OSTree server, just like Photon 1.0 OS does. It will not run, however, the server 'compose tree' as part of installation, as most users will want to start from scratch to create their own image anyway, using different package set and customized settings.\nIn addition to starter photon-base.json, we provide photon-minimal.json and photon-full.json, updated with a 2.0 Refspec. We still fire up an Apache web server, that will point to an empty site initially at the repo directory. Assuming you've customized photon-base.json to you liking, all you need to do is to run the commands you are already familiar with from Chapter 9.\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# ostree --repo=repo init --mode=archive-z2\nroot [ /srv/rpm-ostree ]# rpm-ostree compose tree --repo=repo photon-base.json\nNow if you point a browser to http://, you should see the familiar directory structure of an OSTree repo.\n12.2 Installing an RPM-OSTree host\nPhoton OS 2.0 installer no longer includes a UI option to deploy a host manually - either against a default or a custom server repo, and also there is no official online Photon OS 2.0 OSTree repo published. This is now completely customer driven.Automated host install is supported, as explained in Chapter 7.2 Automated install of a custom host via kickstart.  \n12.3 Rebasing a host from Photon 1.0 to 2.0\nIf kickstart sounds too complicated and we still want to go the UI way like in 1.0, fortunately, there is a workaround that requires an extra step. Also, if you have an installed Photon 1.0 or 1.0 Rev2 that you want to carry to 2.0, you need to rebase it. Notice that I didn't say \"upgrade\".   \nBasically the OSTree repo will switch to a different branch on a different server, following the new server's branch versioning scheme. The net result is that the lots of packages will get changed to newer versions from newer OSTree repo, that has been composed from a newer Photon OS 2.0 RPMS repo. Again, I didn't say \"upgraded\", neither the rebase command output, that lists \"changed\" packages. Some obsolete packages will be removed, new packages will be added, either because they didn't exist in 1.0 repo, or because the new config file includes them.The OS name is the same (Photon), so the content in /var and /etc will be transferred over.  \n\nTo install fresh, deploy a Photon 1.0 Rev2 host default, as described in Chapter 2. Of course, if you already have an existing Photon OS 1.0 host that you want to move to 2.0, skip this step.\nEdit /ostree/repo/config and substitute the url, providing the IP address for the Photon OS 2.0 RPM-OSTree server installed above. This was explained in Chapter 10.ostree should confirm that is the updated server IP for the \"photon\" remote.root@ostree-host [ ~ ]# ostree remote show-url photon\nhttp://10.118.101.180\n\nRebase your host to the new 2.0 server and Refspec.\n```\nroot@ostree-host [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree rebase photon/2.0/x86_64/minimal\n\n549 metadata, 2654 content objects fetched; 119853 KiB transferred in 17

In this guide, Zookeeper will be used.\nDownload the latest stable version of Zookeeper and create the zoo.cfg file under the conf directory:\nZookeeper installation\nroot@pt-swarm-master1 [ ~ ]# mkdir -p /opt/swarm && cd /opt/swarm && wget http://apache.mivzakim.net/zookeeper/stable/zookeeper-3.4.6.tar.gz\nroot@pt-swarm-master1 [ /opt/swarm ]# tar -xf zookeeper-3.4.6.tar.gz && mv zookeeper-3.4.6 zookeeper\nroot@pt-swarm-master1 [ ~ ]# cat /opt/swarm/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg | grep -v '#'\ntickTime=2000\ninitLimit=10\nsyncLimit=5\ndataDir=/var/lib/zookeeper\nclientPort=2181\nserver.1=192.168.0.1:2888:3888\nserver.2=192.168.0.2:2888:3888\nThe dataDir should be an empty, existing directory.\nFrom the Zookeeper documentation: Every machine that is part of the ZooKeeper ensemble should know about every other machine in the ensemble. You accomplish this with the series of lines of the form server.id=host:port:port. You attribute the server id to each machine by creating a file named myid, one for each server, which resides in that server's data directory, as specified by the configuration file parameter dataDir. The myid file consists of a single line containing only the text of that machine's id. So myid of server 1 would contain the text \"1\" and nothing else. The id must be unique within the ensemble and should have a value between 1 and 255.\nSet Zookeeper ID\nroot@pt-swarm-master1 [ ~ ]# echo 1 > /var/lib/zookeeper/myid\n\nProject Photon uses [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd Systemd] for services, so a zookeeper service should be created using systemd unit file.\n\nroot@pt-swarm-master1 [ ~ ]# cat /etc/systemd/system/zookeeper.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Apache ZooKeeper\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nEnvironment=\"JAVA_HOME=/opt/OpenJDK-1.8.0.51-bin\"\nWorkingDirectory=/opt/swarm/zookeeper\nExecStart=/bin/bash -c \"/opt/swarm/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh start-foreground\"\nRestart=on-failure\nRestartSec=20\nUser=root\nGroup=root\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nZookeeper comes with OpenJDK, so having Java on the Photon host is not a prerequisite. Simply direct the Environment variable to the location where the Zookeeper was extracted.\nNow you need to enable and start the service. Enabling the service will make sure that if the host restarts for some reason, the service will automatically start.\nroot@pt-swarm-master1 [ ~ ]# systemctl enable zookeeper\nroot@pt-swarm-master1 [ ~ ]# systemctl start zookeeper\n\nVerify that the service was able to start:\n\nroot@pt-swarm-master1 [ ~ ]# systemctl status zookeeper\nzookeeper.service - Apache ZooKeeper\n   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/zookeeper.service; enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Tue 2016-01-12 00:27:45 UTC; 10s ago\n Main PID: 4310 (java)\n   CGroup: /system.slice/zookeeper.service\n           `-4310 /opt/OpenJDK-1.8.0.51-bin/bin/java -Dzookeeper.log.dir=. -Dzookeeper.root.logger=INFO,CONSOLE -cp /opt/swarm/zookeeper/bin/../build/classes:/opt/swarm/zookeeper/bin/../build/lib/*.jar:/opt/s...\nOn the Manager you elected to be the Swarm Leader (primary), execute the following (if you do not have a specific leader in mind, choose one of the managers randomly):\nroot@pt-swarm-master1 [ ~ ]# docker run -d --name=manager1 -p 8888:2375 swarm manage --replication --advertise 192.168.0.1:8888 zk://192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2/swarm\n\ndocker run -d - run the container in the background.\n--name=manager1 - give the container a name instead of the auto-generated one.\n-p 8888:2375 - publish a container's port(s) to the host. In this case, when you connect to the host in port 8888, it connects to the container in port 2375.\nswarm - the image to use for the container.\nmanage - the command to send to the container once it's up, alongside the rest of the parameters.\n--replication - tells swarm that the manager is part of a a multi-manager configuration and that this primary manager competes with other manager instances for the primary role. The primary manager has the authority to manage the cluster, replicate logs, and replicate events that are happening inside the cluster.\n--advertise 192.168.0.1:8888 - specifies the primary manager address. Swarm uses this address to advertise to the cluster when the node is elected as the primary.\nzk://192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2/swarm - specifies the Zookeepers' location to enable service discovery. The /swarm path is arbitrary, just make sure that every node that joins the cluster specifies that same path (it is meant to enable support for multiple clusters with the same Zookeepers).\n\nOn the second manager, execute the following:\nroot@pt-swarm-master2 [ ~ ]# docker run -d --name=manager2 -p 8888:2375 swarm manage --replication --advertise 192.168.0.2:8888 zk://192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2/swarm\nNotice that the only difference is the --advertise flag value. The first manager will not lose leadership following this command.\nNow 2 managers are alive, one is the primary and another is the replica. When we now look at the docker info on our primary manager, we can see the following information:\ndocker-client:~$ docker -H tcp://192.168.0.1:8888 info\nContainers: 0\nImages: 0\nRole: primary\nStrategy: spread\nFilters: health, port, dependency, affinity, constraint\nNodes: 0\nCPUs: 0\nTotal Memory: 0 B\nName: 82b8516efb7c\nThere are a few things that are worth noticing:\n\nThe info command can be executed from ANY machine that can reach the master. The -H tcp://: command specifies that the docker command should be executed on a remote host.\nContainers - this is the result of the docker ps -a command for the cluster we just set up.\nImages - the result of the docker images command.\nRole - as expected, this is the primary manager.\nStrategy - Swarm has a number of strategies it supports for setting up containers in the cluster. spread means that a new container will run on the node with the least amount of containers on it.\nFilters - Swarm can choose where to run containers based on different filters supplied in the command line. More info can be found here.\n\nWhen we now look at the docker info on our replicated manager, we can see the following information:\ndocker-client:~$ docker -H tcp://192.168.0.2:8888 info\nContainers: 0\nImages: 0\nRole: replica\nPrimary: 192.168.0.1:8888\nStrategy: spread\nFilters: health, port, dependency, affinity, constraint\nNodes: 0\nCPUs: 0\nTotal Memory: 0 B\nName: ac06f826e507\nNotice that the only differences between both managers are:\nRole: as expected, this is the replicated manager.\nPrimary: contains the primary manager.\nSetting Up the Agents\nIn Swarm, in order for a node to become a part of the cluster, it should \"join\" that said cluster - do the following for each of the agents.\nEdit the /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service file so that each agent will be able to join the cluster:\nroot@pt-swarm-agent1 [ ~ ]# cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Docker Daemon\nWants=network-online.target\nAfter=network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/bin/docker daemon -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --cluster-advertise eno16777984:2375 --cluster-store zk://192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2/swarm\nExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID\nKillMode=process\nRestart=always\nMountFlags=slave\nLimitNOFILE=1048576\nLimitNPROC=1048576\nLimitCORE=infinity\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 - This ensures that the Docker remote API on Swarm Agents is available over TCP for the Swarm Manager.\n-H unix:///var/run/docker.sock - The Docker daemon can listen for Docker Remote API requests via three different types of Socket: unix, tcp, and fd. \ntcp - If you need to access the Docker daemon remotely, you need to enable the tcp Socket.\nfd - On Systemd based systems, you can communicate with the daemon via Systemd socket activation.\n\n\n--cluster-advertise :2375 - advertises the machine on the network by stating the ethernet card and the port used by the Swarm Managers.\n--cluster-store zk://192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2/swarm - as we defined before, the service discovery being used here is Zookeeper.\n\nEnable and start the docker service:\nroot@pt-swarm-agent1 [ ~ ]# systemctl enable docker\nroot@pt-swarm-agent1 [ ~ ]# systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart docker\nroot@pt-swarm-agent1 [ ~ ]# systemctl status docker\ndocker.service - Docker Daemon\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Tue 2016-01-12 00:46:18 UTC; 4s ago\n Main PID: 11979 (docker)\n   CGroup: /system.slice/docker.service\n           `-11979 /bin/docker daemon -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --cluster-advertise eno16777984:2375 --cluster-store zk://192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2/swarm\nAll that remains is to have the agents join the cluster:\nroot@pt-swarm-agent1 [ ~ ]# docker run -d swarm join --advertise=192.168.0.3:2375 zk://192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2/swarm\nA look at the output of the docker info command will now show:\ndocker-client:~$ docker -H tcp://192.168.0.1:8888 info\nContainers: 3\nImages: 9\nRole: primary\nStrategy: spread\nFilters: health, port, dependency, affinity, constraint\nNodes: 3\n pt-swarm-agent1.example.com: 192.168.0.3:2375\n  └ Status: Healthy\n  └ Containers: 1\n  └ Reserved CPUs: 0 / 1\n  └ Reserved Memory: 0 B / 2.055 GiB\n  └ Labels: executiondriver=native-0.2, kernelversion=4.1.3-esx, operatingsystem=VMware Photon/Linux, storagedriver=overlay\n pt-swarm-agent2.example.com: 192.168.0.4:2375\n  └ Status: Healthy\n  └ Containers: 1\n  └ Reserved CPUs: 0 / 1\n  └ Reserved Memory: 0 B / 2.055 GiB\n  └ Labels: executiondriver=native-0.2, kernelversion=4.1.3-esx, operatingsystem=VMware Photon/Linux, storagedriver=overlay\n pt-swarm-agent3.example.com: 192.168.0.5:2375\n  └ Status: Healthy\n  └ Containers: 1\n  └ Reserved CPUs: 0 / 1\n  └ Reserved Memory: 0 B / 2.055 GiB\n  └ Labels: executiondriver=native-0.2, kernelversion=4.1.3-esx, operatingsystem=VMware Photon/Linux, storagedriver=overlay\nCPUs: 3\nTotal Memory: 6.166 GiB\nName: 82b8516efb7c\nSetting Up DNS\nDocker does not have its own self-provided DNS so we use a [https://github.com/ahmetalpbalkan/wagl wagl] DNS.\nSetting it up is very simple. In this case, one of the masters will also be the DNS. Simply execute:\ndocker-client:~$ docker run -d --restart=always --name=dns -p 53:53/udp --link manager1:swarm ahmet/wagl wagl --swarm tcp://swarm:2375\n\n--restart=always - Always restart the container regardless of the exit status. When you specify always, the Docker daemon will try to restart the container continuously. The container will also always start on daemon startup, regardless of the current state of the container.\n--link manager1:swarm - link the manager1 container (by name) and give it the alias swarm.\nThat's it, DNS is up and running.\n\nTest Your Cluster\nRunning Nginx\nExecute the following commands from any docker client:\ndocker-client:~$ docker -H tcp://192.168.0.1:8888 run -d -l dns.service=api -l dns.domain=example -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\ndocker-client:~$ docker -H tcp://192.168.0.1:8888 run -d -l dns.service=api -l dns.domain=example -p 80:80 vmwarecna/nginx\nNote that this is the same command, executed twice. It tells the master to run 2 of the similar containers, each of which has 2 dns labels.\nNow, from any container in the cluster that has dnsutils, you can execute the following (for example):\nroot@13271a2d0fcb:/# dig +short A api.example.swarm\n192.168.0.3\n192.168.0.4\nroot@13271a2d0fcb:/# dig +short SRV _api._tcp.example.swarm\n1 1 80 192.168.0.3.\n1 1 80 192.168.0.4.\n"},"Install-and-Configure-a-Production-Ready-Mesos-Cluster-on-Photon-OS.html":{"url":"Install-and-Configure-a-Production-Ready-Mesos-Cluster-on-Photon-OS.html","title":"Setting Up a Mesos Cluster","keywords":"","body":"Install and Configure a Production Ready Mesos Cluster on Photon OS\nOverview\nFor this setup I will use 3 Mesos masters and 3 slaves.

However, if you want a service discovery and load balancing capabilities you will need to use Mesos-DNS and Haproxy. In this How-To I will explain how to install and configure Mesos-DNS for your Mesos cluster.\nMesos-DNS supports service discovery in Apache Mesos clusters. It allows applications and services running on Mesos to find each other through the domain name system (DNS), similarly to how services discover each other throughout the Internet. Applications launched by Marathon are assigned names like search.marathon.mesos. Mesos-DNS translates these names to the IP address and port on the machine currently running each application. To connect to an application in the Mesos datacenter, all you need to know is its name. Every time a connection is initiated, the DNS translation will point to the right machine in the datacenter.\n\nInstallation\nI will explain how to configure Mesos-DNS docker and run it through Marathon. I will show you how to create a configuration file for a mesos-dns-docker container and how to run it via Marathon.\nroot@pt-mesos-node1 [ ~ ]# cat /etc/mesos-dns/config.json\n{\n  \"zk\": \"zk://192.168.0.1:2181,192.168.0.2:2181,192.168.0.3:2181/mesos\",\n  \"masters\": [\"192.168.0.1:5050\", \"192.168.0.2:5050\", \"192.168.0.3:5050\"],\n  \"refreshSeconds\": 60,\n  \"ttl\": 60,\n  \"domain\": \"mesos\",\n  \"port\": 53,\n  \"resolvers\": [\"8.8.8.8\"],\n  \"timeout\": 5,\n  \"httpon\": true,\n  \"dnson\": true,\n  \"httpport\": 8123,\n  \"externalon\": true,\n  \"SOAMname\": \"ns1.mesos\",\n  \"SOARname\": \"root.ns1.mesos\",\n  \"SOARefresh\": 60,\n  \"SOARetry\":   600,\n  \"SOAExpire\":  86400,\n  \"SOAMinttl\": 60\n}\nCreate Application Run File\nNext step is to create a json file and run the service from Marathon for HA.

The instructions present a manual configuration that gets one worker node running to help you understand  the underlying packages, services, ports, and so forth. \nThe Kubernetes package provides several services: kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, kubelet, kube-proxy.  These services are managed by systemd. Their configuration resides in a central location: /etc/kubernetes.  \nThe following instructions break the services up between the hosts.  The first host, photon-master, will be the Kubernetes master.  This host will run the kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler.  In addition, the master will also run etcd. Although etcd is not needed on the master if etcd runs on a different host, this guide assumes that etcd and the Kubernetes master run on the same host.  The remaining host, photon-node, will be the node; it will run kubelet, proxy, and docker.\nSystem Information\nHosts:\nphoton-master = 192.168.121.9\nphoton-node = 192.168.121.65\nPrepare the hosts\nThe following packages should already be installed on the full version of Photon OS, but you might have to install them on the minimal version of Photon OS.

An open-source minimalist Linux operating system from VMware, Photon OS is optimized for cloud computing platforms, VMware vSphere deployments, virtual appliances, and applications native to the cloud.\nThis guide covers the basics of troubleshooting systemd, packages, network interfaces, services such as SSH and Sendmail, the file system, and the Linux kernel. The guide includes a quick tour of the tools that you can use for troubleshooting and provides examples along the way. The guide also demonstrates how to access the system's log files. \nFor information on how to install and manage Photon OS, see the Photon OS Administration Guide.\nSystemd and TDNF\nTwo characteristics of Photon OS stand out: It manages services with systemd, and it manages packages with its own open source, yum-compatible package manager called tdnf, for Tiny DNF. \nBy using systemd, Photon OS adopts a contemporary Linux standard to bootstrap the user space and concurrently start services--an architecture that differs from traditional Linux systems such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11.\n \nA traditional Linux system contains an initialization system called SysVinit. With SLES 11, for instance, SysVinit-style init programs control how the system starts up and shuts down. Init implements system runlevels. A SysVinit runlevel defines a state in which a process or service runs. In contrast to a SysVinit system, systemd defines no such runlevels. Instead, systemd uses a dependency tree of targets to determine which services to start when.\nBecause the systemd commands differ from those of an init.d-based Linux system, a section later in this guide illustrates how to troubleshoot by using systemctl commands instead of init.d-style commands. \nTdnf keeps the operating system as small as possible while preserving yum's robust package-management capabilities. On Photon OS, tdnf is the default package manager for installing new packages. Since troubleshooting with tdnf differs from using yum, a later section of this guide describes how to solve problems with packages and repositories by using tdnf commands.\nThe Root Account and the sudo and su Commands\nThis guide assumes that you are logged in to Photon OS with the root account and running commands as root. The sudo program comes with the full version of Photon OS. On the minimal version, you must install sudo with tdnf if you want to use it. As an alternative to installing sudo on the minimal version, you can switch users as needed with the su command to run commands that require root privileges.\nChecking the Version and Build Number\nTo check the version and build number of Photon OS, concatenate /etc/photon-release. Example: \ncat /etc/photon-release\nVMware Photon Linux 1.0\nPHOTON_BUILD_NUMBER=a6f0f63\nThe build number in the results maps to the commit number on the VMware Photon OS GitHub commits page.\nGeneral Best Practices\nWhen troubleshooting, you should follow some general best practices:\n\nTake a snapshot. Before you do anything to a virtual machine running Photon OS, take a snapshot of the VM so that you can restore it if need be. \n\nMake a backup copy. Before you change a configuration file, make a copy of the original in case you need to restore it later; example: cp /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf.orig\n\nCollect logs. Save the log files associated with a Photon OS problem; you or others might need them later. Include not only the log files on the guest but also the vmware.log file on the host; vmware.log is in the host's directory that contains the VM.\n\nKnow what's in your toolbox. Glance at the man page for a tool before you use it so that you know what your options are. The options can help focus the command's output on the problem you're trying to solve.\n\nUnderstand the system. The more you know about the operating system and how it works, the better you can troubleshoot.\n\n\nLogs on Photon OS\nOn Photon OS, all the system logs except the installation log and the cloud-init log are written into the systemd journal. The journalctl command queries the contents of the systemd journal.\nThe installation log files and the cloud-init log files reside in /var/log. If Photon OS is running on a virtual machine in a VMware hypervisor, the log file for the VMware tools (vmware-vmsvc.log) also resides in /var/log. \nTroubleshooting Progression\nIf you encounter a problem running an application or appliance on Photon OS and you suspect it involves the operating system, you can troubleshoot by proceeding as follows. \nFirst, check the services running on Photon OS:\nsystemctl status\nSecond, check your application's log files for clues. (For VMware applications, see Location of Log Files for VMware Products.)\nThird, check the service controller or service monitor for your application or appliance. \nFourth, check the network interfaces and other aspects of the network service with systemd-network commands.\nFifth, check the operating system's log files: \njournalctl\nNext, run the following commands to view all services according to the order in which they were started:\nsystemd-analyze critical-chain \nFinally, if the previous steps have not revealed enough information to isolate the problem, turn to the troubleshooting tool that you think is most likely to help with the issue at hand. You could, for example, use strace to identify the location of the failure. See the list of troubleshooting tools on Photon OS in a later section. \nSolutions to Common Problems\nThis section describes solutions to problems that you're likely to encounter.\nResetting a Lost Root Password\nHere's how to reset a lost root password. \nFirst, restart the Photon OS machine or the virtual machine running Photon OS. When the Photon OS splash screen appears as it restarts, type the letter e to go to the GNU GRUB edit menu. Be quick about it: Because Photon OS reboots so quickly, you won't have much time to type e. Remember that in vSphere and Workstation, you might have to give the console focus by clicking in its window before it will register input from the keyboard. \nSecond, in the GNU GRUB edit menu, go to the end of the line that starts with linux, add a space, and then add the following code exactly as it appears below:\nrw init=/bin/bash\nAfter you add this code, the GNU GRUB edit menu should look exactly like this:\n \nNow type F10.\nAt the command prompt, type passwd and then type (and re-enter) a new root password that conforms to the password complexity rules of Photon OS. Remember the password. \nNext, type the following command:\numount /\nFinally, type the following command. You must include the -f option to force a reboot; otherwise, the kernel enters a state of panic.\nreboot -f\nThis sequence of commands should look like this:\n\nAfter the Photon OS machine reboots, log in with the new root password. \nFixing Permissions on Network Config Files\nIf you, as the root user, create a new network configuration file on Photon OS, the network service might be unable to process it until you set the file's mode bits to 644.\nIf you query the journal with journalctl -u systemd-networkd, you might see the following error message along with an indication that the network service did not start: \ncould not load configuration files. permission denied\nThe permissions on the network files are the likely cause of this problem. Without the correct permissions, networkd-systemd cannot parse and apply the settings, and the network configuration that you created will not be loaded. \nAfter you create a network configuration file with a .network extension, you must run the chmod command to set the new file's mode bits to 644. Example: \nchmod 644 10-static-en.network\nFor Photon OS to apply the new configuration, you must restart the systemd-networkd service by running the following command: \nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nPermitting Root Login with SSH\nThe full version of Photon OS prevents root login with SSH by default. To permit root login over SSH, open /etc/ssh/sshd_config with the vim text editor and set PermitRootLogin to yes. \nVim is the default text editor available in both the full and minimal versions of Photon OS. (Nano is also in the full version.) After you modify the SSH daemon's configuration file, you must restart the sshd daemon for the changes to take effect. Example: \nvim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n# override default of no subsystems\nSubsystem       sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server\n\n# Example of overriding settings on a per-user basis\n#Match User anoncvs\n#       X11Forwarding no\n#       AllowTcpForwarding no\n#       PermitTTY no\n#       ForceCommand cvs server\nPermitRootLogin yes\nUsePAM yes\nSave your changes in vim and then restart the sshd daemon: \nsystemctl restart sshd\nYou can then connect to the Photon OS machine with the root account over SSH:\nsteve@ubuntu:~$ ssh root@198.51.100.131\nFixing Sendmail If Installed Before an FQDN Was Set\nIf Sendmail is behaving improperly or if it hangs during installation, it is likely that an FQDN is not set. Take the following corrective action. \nFirst, set an FQDN for your Photon OS machine. \nThen, run the following commands in the order below: \necho $(hostname -f) > /etc/mail/local-host-names\n\ncat > /etc/mail/aliases  sendmail.cf\n\nchmod 700 /var/spool/clientmqueue\n\nchown smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/clientmqueue\nCommon Troubleshooting Tools on Photon OS\nThis section describes tools that can help troubleshoot problems. These tools are installed by default on the full version of Photon OS. On the minimal version of Photon OS, you may have to install a tool before you can use it. \nThere is a manual, or man page, on Photon OS for all the tools covered in this section. The man pages provide more information about each tool's commands, options, and output. To view a tool's man page, on the Photon OS command line, type man and then the name of the tool. Example: \nman strace\nSome of the examples in this section are marked as abridged with ellipsis (...).\nTop\nPhoton OS includes the Top tool to monitor system resources, workloads, and performance. It can unmask problems caused by processes or applications overconsuming CPUs, time, or RAM. \nTo view a textual display of resource consumption, run the top command: \ntop\nIn Top, you can kill a runaway or stalled process by typing k followed by its process ID (PID). \n\nIf the percent of CPU utilization is consistently high with little idle time, there might be a runaway process overconsuming CPUs. Restarting the service might solve the problem. \nA handy trick while troubleshooting an unknown issue is to run Top in the background by using batch mode to write its output to a file in order to collect data about performance:\ntop d 120 b >> top120second.output\nFor a list of options that filter top output and other information, see the man page for Top.\nps\nThe ps tool shows the processes running on the machine. The ps tool derives flexibility and power from its options, all of which are covered in the tool's Photon OS man page:\nman ps\nHere are several popular invocations of ps for troubleshooting. \nShow processes by user: \nps aux\nShow processes and child processes by user: \nps auxf\nShow processes containing the string ssh:\nps aux | grep ssh\nShow processes and the command and options with which they were started: \nps auxww\nExample abridged output: \nps auxww\nUSER        PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nroot          1  0.0  0.9  32724  3300 ?        Ss   07:51   0:32 /lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 22\nnetstat\nThe netstat command can identify bottlenecks causing  performance issues. It lists network connections, listening sockets, port information, and interface statistics for different protocols. Examples: \nnetstat --statistics\nnetstat --listening\nfind\nThe find command can be a useful starting point to troubleshoot a Photon OS machine that has stopped working. The following command, for example, lists the files in the root directory that have changed in the past day: \n    find / -mtime -1 \nSee the find manual. Take note of the security considerations listed in the find manual if you are using find to troubleshoot an appliance running on Photon OS. \nLocate\nThe locate command is a fast way to find files and directories when all you have is a keyword. Similar to find and part of the same findutils package preinstalled on the full version of Photon OS by default, the locate command finds file names in the file names database. Before you can use locate accurately, you should update its database: \nupdatedb\nThen you can run locate to quickly find a file, such as any file name containing .network, which can be helpful to see all the system's .network configuration files; abridged example: \nlocate .network\n/etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.freedesktop.network1.conf\n/etc/systemd/network/10-dhcp-en.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-ve.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/busnames.target.wants/org.freedesktop.network1.busname\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/org.freedesktop.network1.busnname\n/usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.network1.service\nThe locate command is also a quick way to see whether a troubleshooting tool is installed on Photon OS. Examples: \nlocate strace\n/usr/bin/strace\n/usr/bin/strace-graph\n/usr/bin/strace-log-merge\n/usr/share/man/man1/strace.1.gz\n/usr/share/vim/vim74/syntax/strace.vim\n\nlocate traceroute\nThe strace tool is there but traceroute is not. You can, however, quickly install traceroute from the Photon OS repository: \ntdnf install traceroute\ndf\nThe df command reports the disk space available on the file system. Because running out of disk space can lead an application to fail, a quick check of the available space makes sense as an early troubleshooting step: \ndf -h\nThe -h option prints out the available and used space in human-readable sizes. After checking the space, you should also check the number of available inodes. Too few available inodes can lead to difficult-to-diagnose problems:\ndf -i\nmd5sum and sha256sum\nmd5sum calculates 128-bit MD5 hashes--a message digest, or digital signature, of a file--to uniquely identify a file and verify its integrity after file transfers, downloads, or disk errors when the security of the file is not in question. Photon OS also includes sha256sum, which is the preferred method of calculating the authenticity of a file to prevent tampering when security is a concern. Photon OS also includes shasum, sha1sum, sha384sum, and sha512sum. See the man pages for  md3sum, sha256sum, and the other SHA utilities. \nmd5sum can help troubleshooting installation issues by verifying that the version of Photon OS being installed matches the version on the Bintray download page. If, for instance, bytes were dropped during the download, the checksums will not match. Try downloading it again. \nstrace\nThe strace utility follows system calls and signals as they are executed so that you can see what an application, command, or process is doing. strace can trace failed commands, identify where a process obtains its configuration, monitor file activity, and find the location of a crash. \nBy tracing system calls, strace can help troubleshoot a broad range of problems, including issues with input-output, memory, interprocess communication, network usage, and application performance. \nFor troubleshooting a problem that gives off few or no clues, the following command displays every system call: \nstrace ls -al\nWith strace commands, you can route the output to a file to make it easier to analyze: \nstrace -o output.txt ls -al\nstrace can reveal the files that an application is trying to open with the -eopen option. This combination can help troubleshoot an application that is failing because it is missing files or being denied access to a file it needs. If, for example, you see \"No such file or directory\" in the results of strace -eopen, something might be wrong: \nstrace -eopen sshd\nopen(\"/usr/lib/x86_64/libpam.so.0\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nopen(\"/usr/lib/libpam.so.0\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nIn the results above, it's OK that the first file is missing because it is found in the next line. In other cases, the application might be unable to open one of its configuration files or reading the wrong one. If the results say \"permission denied\" for one of the files, check the permissions of the file with ls -l or stat.   \nWhen troubleshooting with strace, you can include the process ID in its commands. Here's an example of how to find a process ID: \nps -ef | grep apache\nAnd you can then use strace to examine the file a process is working with: \nstrace -e trace=file -p 1719\nA similar command can trace network traffic: \nstrace -p 812 -e trace=network\nIf an application is crashing, use strace to trace the application and then analyze what happens right before the application crashes.\nYou can also trace the child processes that an application spawns with the fork system call, and you can do so with systemctl commands that start a process to identify why an application crashes immediately or fails to start: \nstrace -f -o output.txt systemctl start httpd\nHere's another example. If journalctl is showing that networkd is failing, you can run strace to help determine why: \nstrace -o output.txt systemctl restart systemd-networkd\nAnd then grep inside the results for something, such as exit or error: \ngrep exit output.txt\nMaybe the results indicate systemd-resolved is going wrong, and you can then strace it, too: \nstrace -f -o output.txt systemctl restart systemd-resolved\nfile\nThe file command determines the file type, which can help troubleshoot problems when an application mistakes one type of file for another, leading it to misbehave. Example: \nfile /usr/sbin/sshd\n/usr/sbin/sshd: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, stripped\nstat\nThe stat command can help troubleshoot problems with files or the file system by showing the last date it was modified and other information. Example:  \nstat /dev/sda1\nFile: '/dev/sda1'\nSize: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   block special file\nDevice: 6h/6d   Inode: 6614        Links: 1     Device type: 8,1\nAccess: (0660/brw-rw----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    8/    disk)\nAccess: 2016-09-02 12:23:56.135999936 +0000\nModify: 2016-09-02 12:23:52.879999981 +0000\nChange: 2016-09-02 12:23:52.879999981 +0000\nBirth: -\nOn Photon OS, stat is handy to show permissions for a file or directory in both their absolute octal notation and their read-write-execute abbreviation; truncated example: \nchmod 777 tester.md\nstat tester.md\n  File: 'tester.md'\n  Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file\nDevice: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316385      Links: 1\nAccess: (0777/-rwxrwxrwx)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nwatch\nThe watch utility runs a command at regular intervals so you can observe how its output changes over time. watch can help dynamically monitor network links, routes, and other information when you are troubleshooting networking or performance issues. Examples: \nwatch -n0 --differences ss\nwatch -n1 --differences ip route\nHere's another example with a screenshot of the command's output. This command monitors the traffic on your network links. The highlighted numbers are updated every second so you can see the traffic fluctuating: \nwatch -n1 --differences ip -s link show up\n  \nvmstat and fdisk\nThe vmstat tool displays statistics about virtual memory, processes, block input-output, disks, and CPU activity. This tool can help diagnose performance problems, especially system bottlenecks.  \nIts output on a Photon OS virtual machine running in VMware Workstation 12 Pro without a heavy load looks like this: \nvmstat\nprocs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----\n r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st\n 0  0      0   5980  72084 172488    0    0    27    44  106  294  1  0 98  1  0\nWhat do all these codes mean? They are explained in the vmstat man page. \nIf r, the number of runnable processes, is higher than 10, the machine is under stress; consider intervening to reduce the number of processes or to distribute some of the processes to other machines. In other words, the machine has a bottleneck in executing processes.\nIf cs, the number of context switches per second, is really high, there may be too many jobs running on the machine. \nIf in, the number of interrupts per second, is relatively high, there might be a bottleneck for network or disk IO. \nYou can investigate disk IO further by using vmstat's -d option to report disk statistics; abridged example on a machine with little load: \nvmstat -d\ndisk- ------------reads------------ ------------writes----------- -----IO------\n       total merged sectors      ms  total merged sectors      ms    cur    sec\nram0       0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nram1       0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nloop0      0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nloop1      0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nsr0        0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nsda    22744    676  470604   12908  72888  24949  805224  127692      0    130\nThe -D option summarizes disk statistics:\nvmstat -D\n           26 disks\n            2 partitions\n        22744 total reads\n          676 merged reads\n       470604 read sectors\n        12908 milli reading\n        73040 writes\n        25001 merged writes\n       806872 written sectors\n       127808 milli writing\n            0 inprogress IO\n          130 milli spent IO\nYou can also get statistics about a partition. First, run the fdisk -l command to list the machine's devices. Then run vmstat -p with the name of a device to view its stats: \nfdisk -l\nDisk /dev/ram0: 4 MiB, 4194304 bytes, 8192 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\n...\nDevice        Start      End  Sectors Size Type\n/dev/sda1      2048 16771071 16769024   8G Linux filesystem\n/dev/sda2  16771072 16777182     6111   3M BIOS boot\n\nvmstat -p /dev/sda1\nsda1          reads   read sectors  writes    requested writes\n               22579     473306      78510     866088\nSee the vmstat man page for more options. \nlsof\nThe lsof command lists open files. And this tool's definition of an open file is quite broad--directories, libraries, streams, domain sockets, and Internet sockets are all considered files, making lsof broadly applicable as a mid-level troubleshooting tool to identify the files a process is using. Because a Linux system like Photon OS uses files to do its work, you can run lsof as root to see how the system is using them and to see how an application works. \nIf, for example, you cannot unmount a disk because it is in use, you can run lsof to identify the files on the disk that are being used. Here's an example showing what's using the root directory: \nlsof /root\nCOMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF   NODE NAME\nbash       879 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nbash      1265 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nsftp-serv 1326 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\ngdb       1351 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nbash      1395 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nlsof      1730 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nYou can do the same with an application or virtual appliance by running lsof with the user name or process ID of the app. Here's an example that lists the open files used by the Apache HTTP Server:  \nlsof -u apache\nRunning the command with the -i option lists all the open network and Internet files, which can help troubleshoot network problems: \nlsof -i\nSee the Unix socket addresses of a user like zookeeper: \nlsof -u zookeeper -U\nAnd here's an example that shows the processes running on Ports 1 through 80:\nlsof -i TCP:1-80\nCOMMAND  PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nhttpd    403   root    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd    407 apache    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd    408 apache    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd    409 apache    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nsshd     820   root    3u  IPv4  11336      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)\nsshd     820   root    4u  IPv6  11343      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)\nsshd    1258   root    3u  IPv4  48040      0t0  TCP 198.51.100.143:ssh->198.51.100.1:49759 (ESTABLISHED)\nsshd    1319   root    3u  IPv4  50866      0t0  TCP 198.51.100.143:ssh->198.51.100.1:51054 (ESTABLISHED)\nsshd    1388   root    3u  IPv4  56438      0t0  TCP 198.51.100.143:ssh->198.51.100.1:60335 (ESTABLISHED)\nYou can also inspect the files opened by a process ID. Here's a truncated example that queries the files open by the systemd network service: \nlsof -p 1917\nCOMMAND    PID            USER   FD      TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF   NODE NAME\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network  cwd       DIR                8,1     4096      2 /\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network  txt       REG                8,1   887896 272389 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network  mem       REG                8,1   270680 262267 /usr/lib/libnss_files-2.22.so\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    0r      CHR                1,3      0t0   5959 /dev/null\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    1u     unix 0x0000000000000000      0t0  45734 type=STREAM\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    3u  netlink                         0t0   6867 ROUTE\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    4u     unix 0x0000000000000000      0t0  45744 type=DGRAM\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    9u  netlink                         0t0  45754 KOBJECT_UEVENT\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network   12u  a_inode               0,11        0   5955 [timerfd]\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network   13u     IPv4             104292      0t0    UDP 198.51.100.143:bootpc\nfuser\nThe fuser command identifies the process IDs of processes using files or sockets. The term process is, in this case, synonymous with user. To identify the process ID of a process using a socket, run fuser with its namespace option and specify tcp or udp and the name of the process or port. Examples: \nfuser -n tcp ssh\nssh/tcp:               940  1308\nfuser -n tcp http\nhttp/tcp:              592   594   595   596\nfuser -n tcp 80\n80/tcp:                592   594   595   596\nldd\nBy revealing the shared libraries that a program depends on, ldd can help troubleshoot an application that is missing a library or finding the wrong one.\nIf, for example, you find output that says \"file not found,\" check the path to the library.  \nldd /usr/sbin/sshd\nlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc0e3e3000)\nlibpam.so.0 => (file not found)\nlibcrypto.so.1.0.0 => /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 (0x00007f624e570000)\nYou can also use the objdump command to show dependencies for a program's object files; example:\nobjdump -p /usr/sbin/sshd | grep NEEDED\ngdb\nThe gdb tool is the GNU debugger. It lets you peer inside a program while it executes or when it crashes so that you can catch bugs on the fly. The gdb tool is typically used to debug programs written in C and C++. On Photon OS, gdb can help you determine why an application crashed. See the man page for gdb for instructions on how to run it. For an extensive example on how to use gdb to troubleshoot Photon OS running on a VM when you cannot login to Photon OS, see the section on troubleshooting boot and logon problems. \nOther Troubleshooting Tools Installed by Default\nThe following troubleshooting tools are included in the full version of Photon OS: \n\ngrep searches files for patterns. \nping tests network connectivity. \nstrings displays the characters in a file to identify its contents.\nlsmod lists loaded modules.\nipcs shows data about the inter-process communication (IPC) resources to which a process has read access--typically, shared memory segments, message queues, and semaphore arrays.\nnm lists symbols from object files. \ndiff compares files side by side. Useful to compare two configuration files when one version works and the other doesn't. \n\nInstalling More Tools from Repositories\nYou can install several troubleshooting tools from the Photon OS repositories by using the default package management system, tdnf. \nIf a tool you need is not installed, the first thing you should do is search the repositories to see whether it's available. The traceroute tool, for example, is not installed by default. Here's how to search for it in the repositories:  \ntdnf search traceroute\ntraceroute : Traces the route taken by packets over an IPv4/IPv6 network\nThe results of the above command show that traceroute exists in the repository. You install it with tdnf: \ntdnf install traceroute\nAdditional tools are not installed by default but are in the repository for instant installation with tdnf: \n\nnet-tools: networking tools.\nltrace: tool for intercepting and recording dynamic library calls. It can identify the function an application was calling when it crashed, making it useful for debugging.\nnfs-utils: client tools for the kernel Network File System, or NFS, including showmount; installed by default in the full version of Photon OS but not in the minimal version. \npcstat: A tool that inspects which pages of a file or files are being cached by the Linux kernel.\nsysstat and sar: Utilities to monitor system performance and usage activity. Installing sysstat also installs sar.\nsystemtap and crash: The systemtap utility is a programmable instrumentation system for diagnosing problems of performance or function. Installing systemtap also installs crash, which is a kernel crash analysis utility for live systems and dump files.\ndstat: versatile tool for viewing and analyzing statistics about system resources.\n\nThe dstat tool, for example, can help troubleshoot system performance. The tool shows a live, running list of statistics about system resources: \ndstat\nYou did not select any stats, using -cdngy by default.\n----total-cpu-usage---- -dsk/total- -net/total- ---paging-- ---system--\nusr sys idl wai hiq siq| read  writ| recv  send|  in   out | int   csw\n  1   0  98   1   0   0|4036B   42k|   0     0 |   0     0 |  95   276\n  1   0  98   1   0   0|   0    64k|  60B  940B|   0     0 | 142   320\n  1   1  98   0   0   0|   0    52k|  60B  476B|   0     0 | 149   385\nLinux Troubleshooting Tools Not on Photon OS\nThe following Linux troubleshoot tools are neither installed on Photon OS by default nor available in the Photon OS repositories: \n\niostat\ntelnet (use SSH instead)\nIprm\nhdparm\nsyslog (use journalctl instead)\nddd\nksysmoops\nxev\nGUI tools (because Photon OS has no GUI)\n\nSystemd\nPhoton OS manages services with systemd and its command-line utility for inspecting and controlling the system, systemctl, not the deprecated commands of init.d. For example, instead of running the /etc/init.d/ssh script to stop and start the OpenSSH server on a init.d-based Linux system, you control the service by running the following systemctl commands on Photon OS: \nsystemctl stop sshd\nsystemctl start sshd\nFor an overview of systemd, see systemd System and Service Manager and the man page for systemd. The systemd man pages are listed at https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/.\nViewing Services\nTo view a description of all the active, loaded units, execute the systemctl command without any options or arguments: \nsystemctl\nTo see all the loaded, active, and inactive units and their description, run this command: \nsystemctl --all\nTo see all the unit files and their current status but no description, run this command: \nsystemctl list-unit-files\nThe grep command filters the services by a search term, a helpful tactic to recall the exact name of a unit file without looking through a long list of names. Example: \nsystemctl list-unit-files | grep network\norg.freedesktop.network1.busname           static\ndbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service      enabled\nsystemd-networkd-wait-online.service       enabled\nsystemd-networkd.service                   enabled\nsystemd-networkd.socket                    enabled\nnetwork-online.target                      static\nnetwork-pre.target                         static\nnetwork.target  \nUsing Systemd Commands Instead of Init.d Commands\nBasic system administration commands on Photon OS differ from those on operating systems that use SysVinit. Since Photon OS uses systemd instead of SysVinit, you must use systemd commands to manage services. \nFor example, to list all the services that you can manage on Photon OS, you run the following command instead of ls /etc/rc.d/init.d/: \nsystemctl list-unit-files --type=service\nSimilarly, to check whether the sshd service is enabled, on Photon OS you run the following command instead of chkconfig sshd:\nsystemctl is-enabled sshd\nThe chkconfig --list command that shows which services are enabled for which runlevel on a SysVinit computer becomes substantially different on Photon OS because there are no runlevels, only targets: \nls /etc/systemd/system/*.wants\nYou can also display similar information with the following command: \nsystemctl list-unit-files --type=service\nHere is a list of some of the systemd commands that take the place of SysVinit commands on Photon OS: \nUSE THIS SYSTEMD COMMAND     INSTEAD OF THIS SYSVINIT COMMAND\nsystemctl start sshd         service sshd start\nsystemctl stop sshd         service sshd stop\nsystemctl restart sshd         service sshd restart\nsystemctl reload sshd         service sshd reload\nsystemctl condrestart sshd     service sshd condrestart\nsystemctl status sshd         service sshd status\nsystemctl enable sshd         chkconfig sshd on\nsystemctl disable sshd         chkconfig sshd off\nsystemctl daemon-reload        chkconfig sshd --add\nAnalyzing System Logs with journalctl\nThe journalctl tool queries the contents of the systemd journal. On Photon OS, all the system logs except the installation log and the cloud-init log are written into the systemd journal. \nIf called without parameters, the journalctl command shows all the contents of the journal, beginning with the oldest entry. To display the output in reverse order with new entries first, include the -r option in the command:\njournalctl -r\nThe journalctl command includes many options to filter its output. For help troubleshooting systemd, two journalctl queries are particularly useful: showing the log entries for the last boot and showing the log entries for a systemd service unit. This command displays the messages that systemd generated during the last time the machine started: \njournalctl -b\nThis command reveals the messages for only the systemd service unit specified by the -u option, which in the following example is the auditing service: \njournalctl -u auditd\nYou can look at the messages for systemd itself or for the network service:\njournalctl -u systemd\njournalctl -u systemd-networkd\nExample:  \nroot@photon-1a0375a0392e [ ~ ]# journalctl -u systemd-networkd\n-- Logs begin at Tue 2016-08-23 14:35:50 UTC, end at Tue 2016-08-23 23:45:44 UTC. --\nAug 23 14:35:52 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd[1]: Starting Network Service...\nAug 23 14:35:52 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd-networkd[458]: Enumeration completed\nAug 23 14:35:52 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd[1]: Started Network Service.\nAug 23 14:35:52 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd-networkd[458]: eth0: Gained carrier\nAug 23 14:35:53 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd-networkd[458]: eth0: DHCPv4 address 198.51.100.1\nAug 23 14:35:54 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd-networkd[458]: eth0: Gained IPv6LL\nAug 23 14:35:54 photon-1a0375a0392e systemd-networkd[458]: eth0: Configured\nFor more information, see journalctl or the journalctl man page by running this command: man journalctl\nInspecting Services with systemd-analyze\nThe systemd-analyze command reveals performance statistics for boot times, traces system services, and verifies unit files. It can help troubleshoot slow system boots and incorrect unit files. See the man page for a list of options. Examples:\nsystemd-analyze blame\n\nsystemd-analyze dump\nNetworking\nManaging the Network Configuration\nThe network service, which is enabled by default, starts when the system boots. You manage the network service by using systemd commands, such as systemd-networkd, systemd-resolvd, and networkctl. You can check its status of the network service by running the following command: \nsystemctl status systemd-networkd\nHere is a healthy result of the command: \n* systemd-networkd.service - Network Service\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Fri 2016-04-29 15:08:51 UTC; 6 days ago\n     Docs: man:systemd-networkd.service(8)\n Main PID: 291 (systemd-network)\n   Status: \"Processing requests...\"\n   CGroup: /system.slice/systemd-networkd.service\n           `-291 /lib/systemd/systemd-networkd\nBecause Photon OS relies on systemd to manage services, you should employ the systemd suite of commands, not deprecated init.d commands or other deprecated commands, to manage networking. \nUse ip and ss Commands Instead of ifconfig and netstat\nAlthough the ifconfig command and the netstat command work on Photon OS, VMware recommends that you use the ip or ss commands. The ifconfig and netstat commands are deprecated. \nFor example, instead of running netstat to display a list of network interfaces, consider running the ss command. Similarly, to display information for IP addresses, instead of running ifconfig -a, run the ip addr command. Examples:\nUSE THIS IPROUTE COMMAND     INSTEAD OF THIS NET-TOOL COMMAND\nip addr                     ifconfig -a\nss                             netstat\nip route                     route\nip maddr                     netstat -g\nip link set eth0 up         ifconfig eth0 up\nip -s neigh                    arp -v\nip link set eth0 mtu 9000    ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000\nUsing the ip route version of a command instead of the net-tools version often provides more complete, accurate information on Photon OS, as the following example demonstrates: \nip neigh\n198.51.100.2 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:e2:02:0f STALE\n198.51.100.254 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:e7:13:d9 STALE\n198.51.100.1 dev eth0 lladdr 00:50:56:c0:00:08 DELAY\n\narp -a\n?

(198.51.100.1) at 00:50:56:c0:00:08 [ether] on eth0\nImportant: If you modify an IPv6 configuration or add an IPv6 interface, you must restart systemd-networkd. Traditional methods of using ifconfig commands will be inadequate to register the changes. Run the following command instead: \nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nInspecting the Status of Network Links with networkctl\nThe networkctl command shows information about network connections that helps you configure networking services and troubleshoot networking problems. You can, for example, progressively add options and arguments to the networkctl command to move from general information about network connections to specific information about a network connection. \nRunning networkctl without options defaults to the list command:  \nnetworkctl\nIDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP\n  1 lo               loopback           carrier     unmanaged\n  2 eth0             ether              routable    configured\n  3 docker0          ether              routable    unmanaged\n 11 vethb0aa7a6      ether              degraded    unmanaged\n 4 links listed.\nRunning networkctl with the status command displays information that looks like this; you can see there are active network links with IP addresses for not only the Ethernet connection but also a Docker container. \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# networkctl status\n*      State: routable\n     Address: 198.51.100.131 on eth0\n              172.17.0.1 on docker0\n              fe80::20c:29ff:fe55:3ca6 on eth0\n              fe80::42:f0ff:fef7:bd81 on docker0\n              fe80::4c84:caff:fe76:a23f on vethb0aa7a6\n     Gateway: 198.51.100.2 on eth0\n         DNS: 198.51.100.2\nYou can then add a network link, such as the Ethernet connection, as the argument of the status command to show specific information about the link: \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# networkctl status eth0\n* 2: eth0\n       Link File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n    Network File: /etc/systemd/network/10-dhcp-en.network\n            Type: ether\n           State: routable (configured)\n            Path: pci-0000:02:01.0\n          Driver: e1000\n      HW Address: 00:0c:29:55:3c:a6 (VMware, Inc.)\n             MTU: 1500\n         Address: 198.51.100.131\n                  fe80::20c:29ff:fe55:3ca6\n         Gateway: 198.51.100.2\n             DNS: 198.51.100.2\n        CLIENTID: ffb6220feb00020000ab116724f520a0a77337\nAnd you can do the same thing with the Docker container: \nnetworkctl status docker0\n* 3: docker0\n       Link File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n    Network File: n/a\n            Type: ether\n           State: routable (unmanaged)\n          Driver: bridge\n      HW Address: 02:42:f0:f7:bd:81\n             MTU: 1500\n         Address: 172.17.0.1\n                  fe80::42:f0ff:fef7:bd81\nIn the example above, it is OK that the state of the Docker container is unmanaged; Docker handles managing the networking for the containers without using systemd-resolved or systemd-networkd. Instead, Docker manages the container's connection by using its bridge drive.\nFor more information about networkctl commands and options, see https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/networkctl.html.\nTurning on Network Debugging\nYou can set systemd-networkd to work in debug mode so that you can analyze log files with debugging information to help troubleshoot networking problems. The following procedure turns on network debugging by adding a drop-in file in /etc/systemd to customize the default systemd configuration in /usr/lib/systemd. \nFirst, run the following command as root to create a directory with this exact name, including the .d extension:\nmkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/\nSecond, run the following command as root to establish a systemd drop-in unit with a debugging configuration for the network service:\ncat > /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-loglevel-debug.conf You must reload the systemctl daemon and restart the systemd-networkd service for the changes to take effect: \nsystemctl daemon-reload\nsystemctl restart systemd-networkd\nVerify that your changes took effect:\nsystemd-delta --type=extended\nView the log files by running this command: \njournalctl -u systemd-networkd\nWhen you are finished debugging the network connections, turn debugging off by deleting the drop-in file: \nrm /etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/10-loglevel-debug.conf\nInstalling the Packages for tcpdump and netcat with tdnf\nThe minimal version of Photon OS leaves out several useful networking tools to keep the operating system lean. Tcpdump, for example, is absent in the minimal version but available in the repository. The minimal version does, however, include the iproute2 tools by default. \nTcpdump captures and analyzes packets on a network interface. On Photon OS, you install tcpdump and its accompanying package libpcap, a C/C++ library for capturing network traffic, by using tdnf, Photon's command-line package manager: \ntdnf install tcpdump\nNetcat, a tool for sending data over network connections with TCP or UDP, appears in neither the minimal nor the full version of Photon OS. But since netcat furnishes powerful options for analyzing, troubleshooting, and debugging network connections, you might want to install it. To do so, run the following command: \ntdnf install netcat\nChecking Firewall Rules\nThe design of Photon OS emphasizes security. On the minimal and full versions of Photon OS, the default security policy turns on the firewall and drops packets from external interfaces and  applications. As a result, you might need to add rules to iptables to permit forwarding, allow protocols like HTTP, and open ports. In other words, you must configure the firewall for your applications and requirements. \nThe default iptables settings on the full version look like this:\niptables --list\nChain INPUT (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED\nACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:ssh\n\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nChain OUTPUT (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nTo find out how to adjust the settings, see the man page for iptables. \nAlthough the default iptables policy accepts SSH connections, the sshd configuration file on the full version of Photon OS  is set to reject SSH connections. See Permitting Root Login with SSH.\nIf you are unable to ping a Photon OS machine, one of the first things you should do is check the firewall rules. Do they allow connectivity for the port and protocol in question? You can supplement the iptables commands by using lsof to, for instance, see the processes listening on ports: \nlsof -i -P -n\nNetmgr\nIf you are running a VMware appliance on Photon OS and the VAMI module has problems or if there are networking issues, you can use the Photon OS netmgr utility to inspect the networking settings. Make sure, in particular, that the IP addresses for the DNS server and other infrastructure are correct. Use tcpdump to analyze the issues. \nIf you get an error code from netmgr, it is a standard Unix error code--enter it into a search engine to obtain more information.\nFile System\nThis section covers troubleshooting the file system.\nChecking Disk Space\nOne of the first simple steps to take when you're troubleshooting is to check how much disk space is available by running the df command: \ndf -h\nAdding a Disk and Partitioning It\nIf the df command shows that the file system is indeed nearing capacity, you can add a new disk on the fly and partition it to increase capacity. \nFirst, add a new disk. You can, for example, add a new disk to a virtual machine by using the VMware vSphere Client. After adding a new disk, check for the new disk by using fdisk; see the section on fdisk below. In the following example, the new disk is named /dev/sdb:\nfdisk -l\nDevice        Start      End  Sectors Size Type\n/dev/sda1      2048 16771071 16769024   8G Linux filesystem\n/dev/sda2  16771072 16777182     6111   3M BIOS boot\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 1 GiB, 1073741824 bytes, 2097152 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nAfter you confirm that Photon OS registers the new disk, you can partition it with the parted wizard. The command to partition the disk on Photon OS is as follows: \nparted /dev/sdb\nAnd then you use the parted wizard to create it (see the man page for parted for more information):\nmklabel gpt\nmkpart ext3 1 1024\nThen you must create a file system on the partition:\nmkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb1\nMake a directory where you will mount the new file system: \nmkdir /newdata\nFinally, open /etc/fstab and add the new file system with the options that you want: \n#system mnt-pt  type    options dump    fsck\n/dev/sda1       /       ext4    defaults,barrier,noatime,noacl,data=ord$\n/dev/cdrom      /mnt/cdrom      iso9660 ro,noauto       0       0\n/dev/sdb1       /newdata        ext3    defaults        0        0\nMount it for now: \nmount /newdata\nCheck your work: \ndf -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/root       7.8G  4.4G  3.1G  59% /\ndevtmpfs        172M     0  172M   0% /dev\ntmpfs           173M     0  173M   0% /dev/shm\ntmpfs           173M  664K  172M   1% /run\ntmpfs           173M     0  173M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\ntmpfs           173M   36K  173M   1% /tmp\ntmpfs            35M     0   35M   0% /run/user/0\n/dev/sdb1       945M  1.3M  895M   1% /newdata\nExpanding Disk Partition\nIf you need more space, you can expand the last partition of your disk after resizing the disk. In the examples we are assuming sda as disk device.\nAfter the disk is resized in the virtual machine, it's necessary to tell the system to recognize the new disk ending boundary without rebooting:\necho 1 > /sys/class/block/sda/device/rescan\nYou will need to install the parted package to resize the disk partition, which is not available by default. Just run the following command to install it: tdnf install parted.\n# parted /dev/sda\nGNU Parted 3.2\nUsing /dev/sda\nWelcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.\nList all partitions available to fix the GPT and check the last partition number:\n(parted) print\n\nWarning: Not all of the space available to /dev/sda appears to be used, you can\nfix the GPT to use all of the space (an extra 4194304 blocks) or continue with\nthe current setting? \nFix/Ignore?\nPress f to fix the GPT layout.\nModel: VMware Virtual disk (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 34.4GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: gpt\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name  Flags\n1      1049kB  3146kB  2097kB                     bios_grub\n2      3146kB  8590MB  8587MB  ext4\nIn this case we have the partition 2 as last, then we extend the partition to 100% of the remaining size:\n(parted) resizepart 2 100%\nFinally, expand the filesystem to the new size:\nresize2fs /dev/sda2\nresize2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)\nFilesystem at /dev/sda2 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required\nold_desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 2\nThe filesystem on /dev/sda2 is now 8387835 (4k) blocks long.\nThe new space is already available in the system:\ndf -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/root        32G  412M   30G   2% /\ndevtmpfs       1001M     0 1001M   0% /dev\ntmpfs          1003M     0 1003M   0% /dev/shm\ntmpfs          1003M  252K 1003M   1% /run\ntmpfs          1003M     0 1003M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\ntmpfs          1003M     0 1003M   0% /tmp\ntmpfs           201M     0  201M   0% /run/user/0\nfdisk\nThe fdisk command manipulates the disk partition table. You can, for example, use fdisk to list the disk partitions so that you can identify the root Linux file system. Here is an truncated example showing /dev/sda1 to be the root Linux partition: \nfdisk -l\nDisk /dev/ram0: 4 MiB, 4194304 bytes, 8192 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\n...\nDisk /dev/sda: 8 GiB, 8589934592 bytes, 16777216 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: gpt\nDisk identifier: 3CFA568B-2C89-4290-8B52-548732A3972D\n\nDevice        Start      End  Sectors Size Type\n/dev/sda1      2048 16771071 16769024   8G Linux filesystem\n/dev/sda2  16771072 16777182     6111   3M BIOS boot\nRemember the fdisk -l command--it will be used later in a section that demonstrates how to reset a lost root password. \nfsck\nThe Photon OS file system includes btrfs and ext4. The default root file system is ext4, which you can see by looking at the file system configuration file, /etc/fstab: \ncat /etc/fstab\n#system mnt-pt  type    options dump    fsck\n/dev/sda1       /       ext4    defaults,barrier,noatime,noacl,data=ordered     1       1\n/dev/cdrom      /mnt/cdrom      iso9660 ro,noauto       0       0\nThe 1 in the fifth column, under fsck, indicates that fsck checks the file system when the system boots.\nYou can manually check the file system by using the file system consistency check tool, fsck, after you unmount the file system. You can also perform a read-only check without unmounting it:\nfsck -nf /dev/sda1\nfsck from util-linux 2.27.1\ne2fsck 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)\nWarning!  /dev/sda1 is mounted.\nWarning: skipping journal recovery because doing a read-only filesystem check.\nPass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes\nPass 2: Checking directory structure\nPass 3: Checking directory connectivity\nPass 4: Checking reference counts\nPass 5: Checking group summary information\nFree blocks count wrong (1439651, counted=1423942).\nFix? no\nFree inodes count wrong (428404, counted=428397).\nFix? no\n/dev/sda1: 95884/524288 files (0.3% non-contiguous), 656477/2096128 blocks\nThe inodes count is probably off because the file system is mounted and in use. To fix problems, you must first unmount the file system and then run fsck again: \numount /dev/sda1\numount: /: target is busy\n        (In some cases useful info about processes that\n         use the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1).)\nSo check it with lsof:\nlsof | grep ^jbd2/sd\njbd2/sda1   99                root  cwd       DIR                8,1     4096          2 /\njbd2/sda1   99                root  rtd       DIR                8,1     4096          2 /\njbd2/sda1   99                root  txt   unknown                                        /proc/99/exe\nThe file system is indeed in use. What troubleshooting tool would you use next to further explore the applications or processes that are using the file system?  \nFixing File System Errors When fsck Fails\nA potential issue is that when fsck runs during startup, it finds a problem that prevents the system from fully booting until you fix the issue by running fsck manually. This kind of a problem can occur when Photon OS is the operating system for a VM running an appliance. \nIf fsck fails when the computer boots and an error message says to run fsck manually, you can troubleshoot by restarting the VM, altering the GRUB edit menu to enter emergency mode before Photon OS fully boots, and running fsck.\n\nTake a snapshot of the virtual machine. \n\nRestart the virtual machine running Photon OS. \n\nWhen the Photon OS splash screen appears as it restarts, type the letter e to go to the GNU GRUB edit menu. Be quick about it: Because Photon OS reboots so quickly, you won't have much time to type e. Remember that in VMware vSphere or VMware Workstation Pro, you might have to give the console focus by clicking in its window before it will register input from the keyboard. \n\nIn the GNU GRUB edit menu, go to the end of the line that starts with linux, add a space, and then add the following code exactly as it appears below:\n systemd.unit=emergency.target\n\nType F10.\n\nIn the bash shell, run one of the following commands to fix the file system errors, depending on whether sda1 or sda2 represents the root file system: \n e2fsck -y /dev/sda1\n or\n e2fsck -y /dev/sda2\n\nRestart the virtual machine.\n\n\nPackages\nOn Photon OS, tdnf is the default package manager. The standard syntax for tdnf commands is the same as that for DNF and Yum: \ntdnf [options]  [...]\nThe main configuration files reside in /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf. The repositories appear in /etc/yum.repos.d/ with .repo file extensions. For more information, see the Photon OS Administration Guide.\nThe cache files for data and metadata reside in /var/cache/tdnf. The local cache is populated with data from the repository: \nls -l /var/cache/tdnf/photon\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 May 18 22:52 repodata\nd-wxr----t 3 root root 4096 May  3 22:51 rpms\nYou can clear the cache to help troubleshoot a problem, but keep in mind that doing so might slow the performance of tdnf until the cache becomes repopulated with data. Cleaning the cache can remove stale information. Here is how to clear the cache: \ntdnf clean all\nCleaning repos: photon photon-extras photon-updates lightwave\nCleaning up everything\nSome tdnf commands can help you troubleshoot problems with packages:\nmakecache: This command updates the cached binary metadata for all known repositories. You can run it after you clean the cache to make sure you are working with the latest repository data as you troubleshoot. Example:\ntdnf makecache\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)Updates'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Extras 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)'\nMetadata cache created.\ntdnf check-local: This command resolves dependencies by using the local RPMs to help check RPMs for quality assurance before publishing them. To check RPMs with this command, you must create a local directory and place your RPMs in it. The command, which includes no options, takes the path to the local directory containing the RPMs as its argument. The command does not, however, recursively parse directories; it checks the RPMs only in the directory that you specify. For example, after creating a directory named /tmp/myrpms and placing your RPMs in it, you can run the following command to check them:  \ntdnf check-local /tmp/myrpms\nChecking all packages from: /tmp/myrpms\nFound 10 packages\nCheck completed without issues\ntdnf provides: This command finds the packages that provide the package that you supply as an argument. If you are used to a package name for another system, you can use tdnf provides to find the corresponding name of the package on Photon OS. Example: \ntdnf provides docker\ndocker-1.11.0-1.ph1.x86_64 : Docker\nRepo     : photon\ndocker-1.11.0-1.ph1.x86_64 : Docker\nRepo     : @System\nFor a file, you must provide the full path. Here's an example: \ntdnf provides /usr/include/stdio.h\nglibc-devel-2.22-8.ph1.x86_64 : Header files for glibc\nRepo     : photon\nglibc-devel-2.22-8.ph1.x86_64 : Header files for glibc\nRepo     : @System\nHere's an example that shows you how to find the package that provides a pluggable authentication module, which you might need to find if the system is mishandling passwords. \ntdnf provides /etc/pam.d/system-account\nshadow-4.2.1-7.ph1.x86_64 : Programs for handling passwords in a secure way\nRepo     : photon\nshadow-4.2.1-8.ph1.x86_64 : Programs for handling passwords in a secure way\nRepo     : photon-updates\nAdditional commands appear in the Photon OS Administration Guide.\nIf you find a package that is installed but is not working, try re-installing it; example: \ntdnf reinstall shadow\nReinstalling:\nshadow     x86_64     4.2.1-7.ph1   3.85 M\nKernel Problems and Boot and Login Problems\nKernel Overview\nPhoton OS 1.0 uses Linux kernel version 4.4. Troubleshooting kernel problems starts with dmesg. The dmesg command prints messages from the kernel ring buffer. The following command, for example, presents kernel messages in a human-readable format: \ndmesg --human --kernel\nTo examine kernel messages as you perform actions, such as reproducing a problem, in another terminal, you can run the command with the --follow option, which waits for new messages and prints them as they occur: \ndmesg --human --kernel --follow\nThe kernel buffer is limited in memory size. As a result, the kernel cyclically overwrites the end of the information in the buffer from which dmesg pulls information. The systemd journal, however, saves the information from the buffer to a log file so that you can access older information. To view it, run the following command: \njournalctl -k\nIf need be, you can check the modules that are loaded on your Photon OS machine by running the lsmod command; truncated example:  \nlsmod\nModule                  Size  Used by\nvmw_vsock_vmci_transport    28672  1\nvsock                  36864  2 vmw_vsock_vmci_transport\ncoretemp               16384  0\nhwmon                  16384  1 coretemp\ncrc32c_intel           24576  0\nhid_generic            16384  0\nusbhid                 28672  0\nhid                   106496  2 hid_generic,usbhid\nxt_conntrack           16384  1\niptable_nat            16384  0\nnf_conntrack_ipv4      16384  2\nnf_defrag_ipv4         16384  1 nf_conntrack_ipv4\nnf_nat_ipv4            16384  1 iptable_nat\nnf_nat                 24576  1 nf_nat_ipv4\niptable_filter         16384  1\nip_tables              24576  2 iptable_filter,iptable_nat\nBoot Process Overview\nWhen a Photon OS machine boots, the BIOS initializes the hardware and uses a boot loader to start the kernel. After the kernel starts, systemd takes over and boots the rest of the operating system. \nMore specifically, the BIOS checks the memory and initializes the keyboard, the screen, and other peripherals. When the BIOS finds the first hard disk, the boot loader--GNU GRUB 2.02--takes over. From the hard disk, GNU GRUB loads the master boot record (MBR) and initializes the root partition of the random-access memory by using initrd. The device manager, udev, provides initrd with the drivers it needs to access the device containing the root file system. Here's what the GNU GRUB edit menu looks like in Photon OS with its default commands to load the boot record and initialize the RAM disk: \n  \nAt this point, the Linux kernel in Photon OS, which is kernel version 4.4.8, takes control. Systemd kicks in, initializes services in parallel, mounts the rest of the file system, and checks the file system for errors. \nBlank Screen on Reboot\nIf the Photon OS kernel enters a state of panic during a reboot and all you see is a blank screen, note the name of the virtual machine running Photon OS and then power off the VM. \nIn the host, open the vmware.log file for the VM. When a kernel panics, the guest VM prints the entire kernel log in  vmware.log in the host's directory containing the VM. This log file contains the output of the dmesg command from the guest, and you can analyze it to help identify the cause of the boot problem. \nHere's an example. After searching for Guest: in the following abridged vmware.log, this line appears, identifying the root cause of the reboot problem: \n2016-08-30T16:02:43.220-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[1.125804] Kernel panic - not syncing: \nVFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)\nFurther inspection finds the following lines: \n2016-08-30T16:02:43.217-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[    1.125782] VFS: Cannot open root device \"sdc1\" or unknown-block(0,0): error -6\n2016-08-30T16:02:43.217-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[    1.125783] Please append a correct \"root=\" boot option; \nhere are the available partitions: \n2016-08-30T16:02:43.217-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[    1.125785] 0100            4096 ram0  (driver?)\n...\n0800         8388608 sda  driver: sd\n2016-08-30T16:02:43.220-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[    1.125802]   0801         8384512 sda1 611e2d9a-a3da-4ac7-9eb9-8d09cb151a93\n2016-08-30T16:02:43.220-07:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: \n[    1.125803]   0802            3055 sda2 8159e59c-b382-40b9-9070-3c5586f3c7d6\nIn this unlikely case, the GRUB configuration points to a root device named sdc1 instead of the correct root device, sda1. You can fix the problem by restoring the GRUB GNU edit screen and the GRUB configuration file (/boot/grub/grub.cfg) to their original configurations. \nInvestigating Strange Behavior\nIf you rebooted to address strange behavior before the reboot of if you encountered strange behavior during the reboot but have reached the shell, you should analyze what happened since the previous boot. Start broad by running the following command to check the logs: \njournalctl\nNext, run the following command to look at what happened since the penultimate reboot: \njournalctl --boot=-1\nThen look at the log from the reboot: \njournalctl -b\nIf need be, examine the logs for the kernel: \njournalctl -k\nCheck which kernel is in use:\nuname -r\nThe kernel version of Photon OS in the full version is 4.4.8. The kernel version of in the OVA version is 4.4.8-esx. With the ESX version of the kernel, some services might not start. Run this command to check the overall status of services: \nsystemctl status \nIf a service is in red, check it: \nsystemctl status service-name\nStart it if need be: \nsystemctl start service-name\nIf looking at the journal and checking the status of services gets you nowhere, run the following systemd-analyze commands to examine the boot time and the speed with which services start.\nsystemd-analyze time\nsystemd-analyze blame\nsystemd-analyze critical-chain\nKeep in mind that the output of these commands might be misleading because one service might just be waiting for another service to finish initializing.\nInvestigating the Guest Kernel When You Cannot Log On\nIf a VM running Photon OS and an application or virtual appliance is behaving so oddly that, for example, you cannot log on to the machine, you can still troubleshoot by extracting the kernel logs from the guest's memory and analyzing them with gdb. \nThis advanced troubleshooting method works when you are running Photon OS as the operating system for an application or appliance on VMware Workstation, Fusion, or ESXi. This approach assumes that the virtual machine running Photon OS is functioning normally. \nThis troubleshooting method has the following requirements: \n\nRoot access to a Linux machine other than the one you are troubleshooting. It can be another Photon OS machine, Ubuntu, or another Linux variant. \nThe vmss2core utility from VMware. It is installed by default in VMware Workstation and some other VMware products. If your system doesn't already contain it, you can download it for free from https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vmss2core.\nA local copy of the Photon OS ISO of the exact same version and release number as the Photon OS machine that you are troubleshooting. \n\nThe process to use this troubleshooting method varies by environment. The examples in this section assume that the troublesome Photon OS virtual machine is running in VMware Workstation 12 Pro on a Microsoft Windows 8 Enterprise host. The examples also use an additional, fully functional Photon OS virtual machine running in Workstation.\nYou can, however, use other hosts, hypervisors, and operating systems--but you will have to adapt the example process below to them. Directory paths, file names, and other aspects might be different on other systems. \nOverview   \nThe process to apply this troubleshooting method goes like this: On a local computer, you open a file on the Photon OS ISO that contains Linux debugging information. Then you suspend the troublesome Photon OS VM and extract the kernel memory logs from the VMware hypervisor running Photon OS. \nNext, you use the vmss2core tool to convert the memory logs into core dump files. The vmss2core utility converts VMware checkpoint state files into formats that third-party debugging tools understand. It can handle both suspend (.vmss) and snapshot (.vmsn) checkpoint state files (hereafter referred to as a vmss file) as well as monolithic and non-monolithic (separate .vmem file) encapsulation of checkpoint state data. See Debugging Virtual Machines with the Checkpoint to Core Tool.\nFinally, you prepare to run the gdb tool by using the debug info file from the ISO to create a .gdbinit file, which you can then analyze with the gdb shell on your local Linux machine.\nAll three components must be in the same directory on a Linux machine.  \nProcess\nFirst, obtain a local copy of the Photon OS ISO of the exact same version and release number as the Photon OS machine that you are troubleshooting and mount the ISO on a Linux machine (or open it on a Windows machine):\nmount /mnt/cdrom\nSecond, locate the following file. (If you opened the Photon OS ISO on a Windows computer, copy the following file to the root folder of a Linux machine.)\n/RPMS/x86_64/linux-debuginfo-4.4.8-6.ph1.x86_64.rpm\nThird, on a Linux machine, run the following rpm2cpio command to convert the RPM file to a cpio file and to extract the contents of the RPM to the current directory:\nrpm2cpio /mnt/cdrom/RPMS/x86_64/linux-debuginfo-4.4.8-6.ph1.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv\nFrom the extracted files, copy the following file to your current directory: \ncp usr/lib/debug/lib/modules/4.4.8/vmlinux-4.4.8.debug .\nRun the following command to download the dmesg functions that will help extract the kernel log from the coredump: \nwget https://github.com/vmware/photon/blob/master/tools/scripts/gdbmacros-for-linux.txt\nMove the file as follows: \nmv gdbmacros-for-linux.txt .gdbinit\nNext, switch to your host machine so you can get the kernel memory files from the VM. Suspend the troublesome VM and locate the .vmss and .vmem files in the virtual machine's directory on the host. Example: \nC:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit (7)>dir\n Volume in drive C is Windows\n Directory of C:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit\n (7)\n09/20/2016  12:22 PM              .\n09/20/2016  12:22 PM              ..\n09/19/2016  03:39 PM       402,653,184 VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmem\n09/20/2016  12:11 PM         5,586,907 VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmss\n09/20/2016  12:11 PM     1,561,001,984 VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-s001.vmdk\n...\n09/20/2016  12:11 PM           300,430 vmware.log\n...\nNow that you have located the .vmss and .vmem files, convert them to one or more core dump files by using the vmss2core tool that comes with Workstation. Here is an example of how to run the command. Be careful with your pathing, escaping, file names, and so forth--all of which might be different from this example on your Windows machine. \nC:\\Users\\shoenisch\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit (7)>C:\\\"Program Files (x86)\\VMware\\VMware Workstation\"\\vmss2core.exe \"VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmss\" \"VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmem\"\nThe result of this command is one or more files with a .core extension plus a digit. Truncated example: \nC:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit (7)>dir\n Directory of C:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit(7)\n09/20/2016  12:22 PM       729,706,496 vmss.core0\nCopy the .core file or files to the your current directory on the Linux machine where you so that you can analyze it with gdb. \nRun the following gdb command to enter the gdb shell attached to the memory core dump file. You might have to change the name of the vmss.core file in the example to match your .core file:\ngdb vmlinux-4.4.8.debug vmss.core0\n\nGNU gdb (GDB) 7.8.2\nCopyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later \nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. \nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law. ...\nType \"show configuration\" for configuration details.\nFor bug reporting instructions, please see:\n.\nFind the GDB manual and other documentation resources online at: .\nFor help, type \"help\".\nType \"apropos word\" to search for commands related to \"word\"...\nReading symbols from vmlinux-4.4.8.debug...done.\nwarning: core file may not match specified executable file.\n[New LWP 12345]\nCore was generated by `GuestVM'.\nProgram terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n#0  0xffffffff813df39a in insb (count=0, addr=0xffffc90000144000, port=)\n    at arch/x86/include/asm/io.h:316\n316     arch/x86/include/asm/io.h: No such file or directory.\n(gdb)\nIn the results above, the (gdb) of the last line is the prompt of the gdb shell. You can now analyze the core dump by using commands like bt (to perform a backtrace) and dmesg (to view the Photon OS kernel log and see Photon OS kernel error messages). \nKernel Log Replication with VProbes\nReplicating the Photon OS kernel logs on the VMware ESXi host is an advanced but powerful method of troubleshooting a kernel problem. This method is applicable when the virtual machine running Photon OS is hanging or inaccessible because, for instance, the hard disk has failed.\nThere is a prerequisite, however: You must have preemptively enabled the VMware VProbes facility on the VM before a problem rendered it inaccessible. You must also create a VProbes script on the ESXi host, but you can do that after the fact. \nAlthough the foresight to implement these prerequisites might limit the application of this troubleshooting method for production systems, the method can be particularly useful in analyzing kernel issues when testing an application or appliance that is running on Photon OS.   \nThere are two similar ways in which you can replicate the Photon OS kernel logs on ESXi by using VProbes. The first modifies the VProbes script so that it works only for the VM that you set; it uses a hard-coded address. The second uses an abstraction instead of a hard-coded address so that the same VProbes script can be used for any VM on an ESXi host that you have enabled for VProbe and copied its kernel symbol table (kallsyms) to ESXi.\nFor more information on VMware VProbes, see VProbes: Deep Observability Into the ESXi Hypervisor and the VProbes Programming Reference.\nUsing VProbes Script with a Hard-Coded Address\nHere's how to set a VProbe for an individual VM: \nFirst, power off the VM so that you can turn on the VProbe facility. Edit the .vmx configuration file for the VM. The file resides in the directory that contains the VM in the ESXi data store. Add the following line of code to the .vmx file and then power the VM on: \nvprobe.enable = \"TRUE\"\nWhen you edit the .vmx file to add the above line of code, you must first turn off the VM--otherwise, your changes will not persist. \nSecond, obtain the kernel log_store function address by connecting to the VM with SSH and running the following commands as root. (Photon OS uses the kptr_restrict setting to place restrictions on the kernel addresses exposed through /proc and other interfaces. This setting hides exposed kernel pointers to prevent attackers from exploiting kernel write vulnerabilities. When you are done using VProbes, you should return kptr_restrict to the original setting of 2 by rebooting.)\necho 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict\ngrep log_store /proc/kallsyms\nThe output of the grep command will look similar to the following string. The first set of characters (without the t) is the log_store function address:\nffffffff810bb680 t log_store\nThird, connect to the ESXi host with SSH so that you can create a VProbes script. Here's the template for the script; log_store in the first line is a placeholder for the VM's log_store function address: \nGUEST:ENTER:log_store {\n   string dst;\n   getgueststr(dst, getguest(RSP+16) & 0xff, getguest(RSP+8));\n   printf(\"%s\\n\", dst);\n}\nOn the ESXi host, create a new file, add the template to it, and then change log_store to the function address that was the output from the grep command on the VM. \nYou must add a 0x prefix to the function address. In this example, the modified template looks like this: \nGUEST:ENTER:0xffffffff810bb680 {\n   string dst;\n   getgueststr(dst, getguest(RSP+16) & 0xff, getguest(RSP+8));\n   printf(\"%s\\n\", dst);\n}\nSave your VProbes script as console.emt in the /tmp directory. (The file extension for VProbe scripts is .emt.) \nWhile still connected to the ESXi host with SSH, run the following command to obtain the ID of the virtual machine that you want to troubleshoot: \nvim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms\nThis command lists all the VMs running on the ESXi host. Find the VM you want to troubleshoot in the list and make a note of its ID. \nFinally, run the following command to print all the kernel messages from Photon OS in your SSH console; replace  with the ID of your VM:  \nvprobe -m  /tmp/console.emt\nWhen you're done, type Ctrl-C to stop the loop. \nA Reusable VProbe Script Using the kallsyms File\nHere's how to create one VProbe script and use for all the VMs on your ESXi host. \nFirst, power off the VM and turn on the VProbe facility on each VM that you want to be able to analyze. Add vprobe.enable = \"TRUE\" to the VM's .vmx configuration file. See the instructions above. \nSecond, power on the VM, connect to it with SSH, and run the following command as root: \necho 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict\nThird, connect to the ESXi host with SSH to create the following VProbes script and save it as /tmp/console.emt:\nGUEST:ENTER:log_store {\n   string dst;\n   getgueststr(dst, getguest(RSP+16) & 0xff, getguest(RSP+8));\n   printf(\"%s\\n\", dst);\n}\nFourth, from the ESXi host, run the following command to copy the VM's kallysms file to the tmp directory on the ESXi host: \nscp root@:/proc/kallsyms /tmp\nWhile still connected to the ESXi host with SSH, run the following command to obtain the ID of the virtual machine that you want to troubleshoot: \nvim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms\nThis command lists all the VMs running on the ESXi host. Find the VM you want to troubleshoot in the list and make a note of its ID. \nFinally, run the following command to print all the kernel messages from Photon OS in your SSH console; replace  with the ID of your VM. When you're done, type Ctrl-C to stop the loop.  \nvprobe -m  -k /tmp/kallysyms /tmp/console.emt\nYou can use a directory other than tmp if you want.\n\n\nPerformance Issues\nPerformance issues can be difficult to troubleshoot because so many variables play a role in overall system performance. Interpreting performance data often depends on the context and the situation. To better identify and isolate variables and to gain insight into performance data, you can use the troubleshooting tools on Photon OS to diagnose the system.  \nIf you have no indication what the cause of a performance degradation might be, start by getting a broad picture of the system's state. Then look for clues in the data that might point to a cause. The systemd journal is a useful place to start. \nThe top tool can unmask problems caused by processes or applications overconsuming CPUs, time, or RAM. If the percent of CPU utilization is consistently high with little idle time, for example, there might be a runaway process. Restart it. \nThe netstat --statistics command can identify bottlenecks causing performance issues. It lists interface statistics for different protocols. \nIf top and netstat reveal no clues, run the strace ls -al to view every system call.\nThe following watch command can help dynamically monitor a command to help troubleshoot performance issues:\nwatch -n0 --differences \nYou can, for example, combine watch with the vmstat command to dig deeper into statistics about virtual memory, processes, block input-output, disks, and CPU activity. Are there any bottlenecks? \nAnother option is to use the dstat utility. It shows a live, running list of statistics about system resources. \nIn addition, systemd-analyze, which reveals performance statistics for boot times, can help troubleshoot slow system boots and incorrect unit files.\nThe additional tools that you select depend on the clues that your initial investigation reveals. The following tools can also help troubleshoot performance: sysstat, sar, systemtap, and crash. \n"},"Frequently-Asked-Questions.html":{"url":"Frequently-Asked-Questions.html","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","keywords":"","body":"Photon OS Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is Photon OS?\nHow do I get started with Photon OS?\nCan I upgrade my existing Photon OS 1.0 VMs?\nWhat kind of support comes with Photon OS?\nHow can I contribute to Photon OS?\nHow is Photon OS patched?\nHow does Photon OS relate to Project Lightwave?\nWill VMware continue to support other container host runtime offerings on vSphere?\nHow to report a security vulnerability in Photon OS?\nWhat are the Docker improvements in Photon OS 2.0?\nWhy is VMware creating Photon OS?\nWhy is VMware open-sourcing Photon OS?\nIn what way is Photon OS \"optimized for VMware?\"\nWhy can't I SSH in as root?\nWhy isn't netstat working?\nWhy do all of my cloned Photon OS instances have the same IP address when using DHCP?\nHow to install new packages?\nWhy is the yum command not working in a minimal installation?\nHow to install all build essentials?\nHow to build new package for Photon OS?\nI just booted into freshly installed Photon OS instance, why isn't \"docker ps\" working?\nWhat is the difference between Minimal and Full installation?\nWhat packages are included in Minimal and Full?\nHow do I transfer or share files between Photon OS and my host machine?\nWhy is the ISO over 2GB, when I hear that Photon OS is a minimal container runtime?\n\n\nGetting Started\nQ. What is Photon OS?\nA. Photon OS™ is an open source Linux container host optimized for cloud-native applications, cloud platforms, and VMware infrastructure. Photon OS provides a secure run-time environment for efficiently running containers. For an overview, see https://vmware.github.io/photon/.\nQ. How do I get started with Photon OS?\nA. Start by deciding your target platform. Photon OS 2.0 has been certified in public cloud environments - Microsoft Azure (new), Google Compute Engine (GCE), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - as well as on VMware vSphere, VMware Fusion, and VMware Workstation.\nNext, download the latest binary distributions for your target platform. The binaries are hosted on https://bintray.com/vmware/photon/. For download instructions, see Downloading Photon OS.\nFinally, go to the installation instructions for your target platform, which are listed here:  Quick Start.\nQ. Can I upgrade my existing Photon OS 1.0 VMs?\nA. Yes, there is an in-place upgrade path for Photon OS 1.0 implementations. You simply download an upgrade package, run a script, and reboot the VM. Refer to the instructions in Upgrading to Photon OS 2.0.\nQ. What kind of support comes with Photon OS?\nA. Photon OS is supported through community efforts and direct developer engagement in the communities. Potential users of Photon OS should start with the Photon microsite.\nDevelopers who might want the source code, including those interested in making contributions, should visit the Photon OS Github repository. \nQ. How can I contribute to Photon OS?\nA. We welcome community participation in the development of Photon OS and look forward to broad ecosystem engagement around the project. Getting your idea into Photon OS is just a GitHub pull request away. When you submit a pull request, you'll be asked to accept the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). \nQ. How is Photon OS patched?\nA. Within a major release, updates will be delivered as package updates. Security updates will be delivered on an as-needed basis. Non-security related updates will happen quarterly, but may not include every, single package update. The focus is on delivering a valid, functional updated stack every quarter.\nPhoton OS isn't \"patched,\" as a whole - instead, individual packages are updated (potentially, with patches applied to that individual package). For instance, if a package releases a fix for a critical vulnerability, we'll update the package in the Photon OS repository, for critical issues probably within a day or two. At that point, customers get that updated package by running, \"tdnf update \"\nQ. How does Photon OS relate to Project Lightwave?\nA. Project Lightwave is an open-sourced project that provides enterprise-grade identity and access management services, and can be used to solve key security, governance, and compliance challenges for a variety of use cases within the enterprise.\nThrough integration between Photon OS and Project Lightwave, organizations can enforce security and \ngovernance on container workloads, for example, by ensuring only authorized containers are run on authorized hosts, by authorized users. For details about Lightwave, see https://github.com/vmware/lightwave.\nQ. Will VMware continue to support other container host runtime offerings on vSphere?\nA. YES, VMware is committed to delivering an infrastructure for all workloads, and for vSphere to have the largest guest OS support in the industry and support customer choice. \nToward those goals, VMware will continue to work with our technology partners to support new Guest Operating Systems and container host runtimes as they come to the market. Open-sourcing Photon OS will enable optimizations and enhancements for container host runtimes on VMware Platform are available as reference implementation for other container host runtimes as well.\nPhoton OS\nQ.

VMware has established an email address that should be used for reporting a vulnerability. Please send descriptions of any vulnerabilities found to security@vmware.com. Please include details on the software and hardware configuration of your system so that we can duplicate the issue being reported.\nNote: We encourage use of encrypted email. Our public PGP key is found at kb.vmware.com/kb/1055.\nVMware hopes that users encountering a new vulnerability will contact us privately as it is in the best interests of our customers that VMware has an opportunity to investigate and confirm a suspected vulnerability before it becomes public knowledge.\nIn the case of vulnerabilities found in third-party software components used in VMware products, please also notify VMware as described above.\nQ. What are the Docker improvements in Photon OS 2.0?\nIn Photon OS 2.0, the Docker image size (compressed and uncompressed) was reduced to less than a third of its size in Photon OS 1.0. This gain resulted from:\n\nusing toybox (instead of standard core tools), which brings the docker image size from 50MB (in 1.0) to 14MB (in 2.0)\na package split - in Photon OS 2.0, the binary set contains only bash, tdnf, and toybox; all other installed packages are now libraries only.\n\nQ. Why is VMware creating Photon OS?\nA. It's about workloads - VMware has always positioned our vSphere platform as a secure, highly-performant platform for enterprise applications. With containers, providing an optimized runtime ensures that customers can embrace these new workload technologies without disrupting existing operations. Over time, Photon OS will extend the capabilities of the software-defined data center such as security, identity and resource management to containerized workloads. Organizations can then leverage a single infrastructure architecture for both traditional and cloud-native Apps, and leverage existing investments in tools, skills and technologies. This converged environment will simplify operation and troubleshooting, and ease the adoption of Cloud-Native Apps. \nPhoton OS can provide a reference implementation for optimizing containers on VMware platforms across compute, network, storage and management. For example, Photon OS can deliver performance through kernel tuning to remove redundant caching between the Linux kernel and the vSphere hypervisor, and advanced security services through network micro-segmentation delivered by VMware NSX™, and more.\nQ. Why is VMware open-sourcing Photon OS?\nA. Open-sourcing Photon OS encourages discussion, innovation, and collaboration with others in the container ecosystem. In particular, we want to make sure the innovations we introduce to Photon to run containers effectively on VMware are also available to any other container runtime OS. \nAdditionally, VMware is committed to supporting industry and de facto standards, as doing so also supports stronger security, interoperability, and choice for our customers. \nQ. In what way is Photon OS \"optimized for VMware?\"\nPhoton OS 1.0 introduced extensive optimizations for VMware environments, which are described in detail in the following VMware white paper: Deploying Cloud-Native Applications with Photon OS. Photon OS 2.0 enhances VMware optimization. The kernel message dumper (new in Photon OS 2.0) is a paravirt feature that extends debugging support. In case of a guest panic, the kernel (through the paravirt channel) dumps the entire kernel log buffer (including the panic message) into the VMware log file (vmware.log) for easy, consolidated access. Previously, this information was stored in a huge vmss (VM suspend state) file.\nQ. Why can't I SSH in as root?\nA. By default Photon does not permit root login to ssh. To make yourself login as root using SSH set PermitRootLogin yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and restart the sshd deamon.\nQ. Why is netstat not working?\nA. netstat is deprecated, ss or ip (part of iproute2) should be used instead.\nQ. Why do all of my cloned Photon OS instances have the same IP address when using DHCP?\nA. Photon OS uses the contents of /etc/machine-id to determine the duid that is used for DHCP requests. If you're going to use a Photon OS instance as the base system for cloning to create additional Photon OS instances, you should clear the machine-id with:\n    echo -n > /etc/machine-id\nWith this value cleared, systemd will regenerate the machine-id and, as a result, all DHCP requests will contain a unique duid. \nHow to install new packages?\nQ. Why is the yum command not working in a minimal installation?\nA. yum has package dependencies that make the system larger than it needs to be. Photon OS includes tdnf - 'tiny' dandified yum - to provide package management and yum-functionality in a much, much smaller footprint. To install packages from cdrom, mount cdrom using following command\n     mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom\nThen, you can use tdnf to install new packages. For example, to install the vim editor, \n     tdnf install vim\nQ. How to install all build essentials?\nA. Following command can be used to install all build essentials.\ncurl -L https://git.io/v1boE | xargs -I {} tdnf install -y {}\nQ. How to build new package for Photon OS??\nA. Assuming you have an Ubuntu development environment, setup and get the latest code pull into /workspace. Lets assume your package name is foo with version 1.0.\n    cp foo-1.0.tar.gz /workspace/photon/SOURCES\n    cp foo.spec /workspace/photon/SPECS/foo/\n    cd /workspace/photon/support/package-builder\n    sudo python ./build_package.py -i foo\nQ. I just booted into freshly installed Photon OS instance, why isn't \"docker ps\" working?\nA. Make sure docker daemon is running. By design and default in Photon OS, the docker daemon/engine is not started at boot time. To start the docker daemon for the current session, use the command:\n    systemctl start docker\nTo start the docker daemon, on boot, use the command:\n    systemctl enable docker\nQ. What is the difference between Minimal and Full installation?\nA. Minimal is the minimal set of packages for a container runtime, plus cloud-init.\nFull contains all the packages shipped with ISO.\nQ. What packages are included in Minimal and Full?\nA. See packages_minimal.json as an example\nQ. How do I transfer or share files between Photon and my host machine?\nA. Use vmhgfs-fuse to transfer files between Photon and your host machine:\n\nEnable Shared folders in the Workstation or Fusion UI (edit the VM settings and choose Options->Enabled shared folders).\nMake sure open-vm-tools is installed (it is installed by default in the Minimal installation and OVA import).\nRun vmware-hgfsclient to list the shares.\n\nNext, do one of the following:\n\nRun the following to mount:\nvmhgfs-fuse .host:/$(vmware-hgfsclient) /mnt/hgfs\nOR\n\nAdd the following line to /etc/fstab:\n.host:/ /mnt/hgfs fuse.vmhgfs-fuse  0 0\n\n\nQ. Why is the ISO over 2GB, when I hear that Photon OS is a minimal container runtime?\nA. ISO includes a repository with all Photon OS packages. When you mount the ISO to a machine and boot to the Photon installer, you'll be able to choose the Photon Minimal installation option and the hypervisor-optimized Linux kernel, which will reduce the storage size.\n"}}}
