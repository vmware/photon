As a lightweight and extensible operating system, Photon OS works with the most common container formats, including Docker, Rocket, and Garden. Photon OS includes a yum-compatible, package-based lifecycle management system called tdnf.\nWhen used with development tools and environments such as VMware Fusion, VMware Workstation, and production runtime environments (vSphere, vCloud Air), Photon OS lets you seamlessly migrate container-based applications from development to production. With a small footprint and fast boot and run times, Photon OS is optimized for cloud computing and cloud  applications.  \n"},"PhotonOS-versions.html":{"url":"PhotonOS-versions.html","title":"Versions","keywords":"","body":"Versions\nPhoton OS consists of a minimal version and a full version. \nThe minimal version of Photon OS is lightweight container host runtime environment that is suited to managing and hosting containers. The minimal version contains just enough packaging and functionality to manage and modify containers while remaining a fast runtime environment. The minimal version is ready to work with appliances. \nThe full version of Photon OS includes additional packages to help you customize the system and create containerized applications. For running containers, the full version is excessive. The full version is helps you create, develop, test, and package an application that runs a container. \n"},"features.html":{"url":"features.html","title":"Features","keywords":"","body":"Features\nThe two distinguishing features of Photon OS are as follows:\n\nIt manages services with systemd. \n  By using systemd, Photon OS adopts a contemporary Linux standard to manage system services. Photon OS bootstraps the user space and concurrently starts services with systemd. The systemctl utility controls services on Photon OS. For example, instead of running the /etc/init.d/ssh script to stop and start the OpenSSH server on a init.d-based Linux system, you run the following systemctl commands on Photon OS: \n\nsystemctl stop sshd\nsystemctl start sshd\n\n\n\n\nIt manages packages with an open source, yum-compatible package manager called tdnf for Tiny DNF.\n  Tdnf keeps the operating system as small as possible while preserving yum's robust package-management capabilities. On Photon OS, tdnf is the default package manager for installing new packages. It is a C implementation of the DNF package manager. \n\n\n"},"What-is-New-in-Photon-OS-3.0.html":{"url":"What-is-New-in-Photon-OS-3.0.html","title":"What's New in Photon OS 3.0","keywords":"","body":"What is New in Photon OS 3.0\nPhoton OS 3.0 introduces support for ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 3), installer improvements, and up-to-date OSS packages including Linux kernel, systemd and glibc. \nFeatures\nARM64\n\nSupport for Raspberry Pi 3 pre-built image and the ability to build new images in the image builder.\n\nInstaller Updates\n\nAbility to run the installer from multiple media, such as USB, CDROM, and Kickstart, on a wider range of storage devices.\n\nPackage and Binary Maintenance\n\nCloud-ready images for rapid deployment on Microsoft Azure (new), Google Compute Engine (GCE), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and VMware products (vSphere, Fusion, and Workstation)\nNew package versions for the following base OS packages:\nLinux kernel 4.18\nGlibc 2.28\nsystemd 239\nPython3 3.7\nOpenjdk : 1.8.0.181, 1.9.0.181 and 1.10.0.23\n\n\nUp-to-date versions for most packages available in the repository.\nAbility to support multiple versions of the same package (For example, go-1.9 and go-1.10).\nSupport for new packages including EdgeX, Liota, linux-firmware, wpa-supplicant for WLAN, consul, meson, and so on.\n\nKnown Issues\n\nThe OVA does not deploy on Workstation 14 but works on later and earlier versions.\nThe Dialog package cannot be installed in 3.0.\nNot all packages in the x86-64 repo are available for ARM64.

For simply running containers, Photon Full will be overkill. Use Photon Full for developing and packaging the application that will be run as a container, as well as authoring the container, itself. For testing and validation purposes, Photon Full will include all components necessary to run containers.\n \n \n Photon OSTree Server\n This installation profile will create the server instance that will host the filesystem tree and managed definitions for rpm-ostree managed hosts created with the \"Photon OSTree Host\" installation profile. Most environments should need only one Photon OSTree Server instance to manage the state of the Photon OSTree Hosts. Use Photon OSTree Server when you are establishing a new repository and management node for Photon OS hosts.\n \n \n \n\n Note: The option you choose determines the disk and memory resources required for your installation.\n Select the option you want and press the Enter key.\n\nSelect the Linux Kernel\n The installer prompts you to select the Linux kernel to install:\n \n\nHypervisor optimized means that any components that are not needed for running under a VMware hypervisor have been removed for faster boot times.\nGeneric means that all components are included.\n\n\nSpecify the Hostname\n The installer prompts you for a hostname and suggest a randomly generated, unique hostname that you can change if you want.\n \n Press the Enter key.\n\nSpecify the System root Password\n Note: Photon OS will not permit commonly used dictionary words to be set as a root password.\n The installer prompts you to enter the system root password.

The cloud-init service configures the cloud instance of a Linux image. An instance is a virtual server in the Amazon cloud. \nThe examples in this section show how to generate SSH and RSA keys for your Photon instance, upload the Photon OS .ami image to the Amazon cloud, and configure it with cloud-init. In the examples, replace information with your own paths, account details, or other information from Amazon. \nPerform the following steps to set up Photon OS on EC2\n\nCreate a key pair.\n Generate SSH keys on, for instance, an Ubuntu workstation: \n ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/mykeypair\n The command generates a public key in the file with a .pub extension and a private key in a file with no extension. Keep the private key file and remember the name of your key pair. The name is the file name of the two files without an extension. You will need the name later to connect to the Photon instance.\n Change the mode bits of the public key pair file to protect its security. In the command, include the path to the file if you need to.  \n chmod 600 mykeypair.pub\n Change the mode bits on your private key pair file so that only you can view it:  \n chmod 400 mykeypair\n To import your public key pair file, but not your private key pair file, connect to the EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ and select the region for the key pair. A key pair works only in one region, and the instance of Photon OS that will be uploaded later must be in the same region as the key pair. Select key pairs under Network & Security, and then import the public key pair file that you generated earlier. \n For more information, see Importing Your Own Key Pair to Amazon EC2.\n\nGenerate a certificate.\n When you bundle up an image for EC2, Amazon requires an RSA user signing certificate. You create the certificate by using openssl to first generate a private RSA key and then to generate the RSA certificate that references the private RSA key. Amazon uses the pairing of the private key and the user signing certificate for  handshake verification. \n\nOn Ubuntu 14.04 or another workstation that includes openssl, run the following command to generate a private key. If you change the name of the key, keep in mind that you will need to include the name of the key in the next command, which generates the certificate.\nopenssl genrsa 2048 > myprivatersakey.pem\n Make a note of your private key as you will need it again later. \n\nRun the following command to generate the certificate. The command prompts you to provide more information, but because you are generating a user signing certificate, not a server certificate, you can just type Enter for each prompt to leave all the fields blank.\nopenssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -key myprivatersakey.pem -outform PEM -out certificate.pem\n For more information, see the Create a Private Key and the Create the User Signing Certificate sections of Setting Up the AMI Tools.\n\nUpload to AWS the certificate value from the certificate.pem file that you created in the previous command. Go to the Identity and Access Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/, navigate to the name of your user, open the Security Credentials section, click Manage Signing Certificates, and then click Upload Signing Certificate. Open certificate.pem in a text editor, copy and paste the contents of the file into the Certificate Body field, and then click Upload Signing Certificate.\n\nFor more information, see the Upload the User Signing Certificate section of Setting Up the AMI Tools.\n\n\n\nCreate a security group.\n Create a security group and set it to allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS connections over ports 22, 80, and 443, respectively.\n Connect to the EC2 command-line interface and run the following commands: \n aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name photon-sg --description \"My Photon security group\"\n {\n     \"GroupId\": \"sg-d027efb4\"\n }\n aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name photon-sg --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0\n Make a note of the GroupId that is returned by EC2 as you will need it again later.\n By using 0.0.0.0/0 for SSH ingress on Port 22, you open the port to all IP addresses--which is not a security best practice but a convenience for the examples in this article. For a production instance or other instances that are anything more than temporary machines, you must authorize only a specific IP address or range of addresses. For more information, see Authorizing Inbound Traffic for Linux Instances.\n Repeat the command to allow incoming traffic on Port 80 and on Port 443: \n aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name photon-sg --protocol tcp --port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0\n\n aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name photon-sg --protocol tcp --port 443 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0\n Check your update: \n aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-names photon-sg\n\nExtract the tarball.\n Make a directory to store the image and then extract the Photon OS image from its archive by running the following tar command. If required, change the file name to match the version you have.    \n mkdir bundled\n tar -zxvf ./photon-ami.tar.gz\n\nBundle the image.\n Run the ec2-bundle-image command to create an instance store-backed Linux AMI from the Photon OS image that you extracted in the previous step. The result of the ec2-bundle-image command is a manifest that describes the machine in an XML file. \n The command uses the certificate path to your PEM-encoded RSA public key certificate file, the path to your PEM-encoded RSA private key file, your EC2 user account ID; the correct architecture for Photon OS, the path to the Photon OS AMI image extracted from its tar file, and the bundled directory from the previous step. \n Replace the values of the certificate path, the private key, and the user account with your own values.\n $ ec2-bundle-image --cert certificate.pem --privatekey myprivatersakey.pem --user   --arch x86_64 --image photon-ami.raw --destination ./bundled/\n\nPut the bundle in a bucket.\n Make an S3 bucket, replacing  with the name that you want. The command creates the bucket in the region specified in your Amazon configuration file, which should be the same region in which you are using your key pair file: \n $ aws s3 mb s3://\n Upload the bundle to the Amazon S3 cloud. The following command includes the path to the XML file containing the manifest for the Photon OS machine created during the previous step, though you might have to change the file name to match the version you have. The manifest file is typically located in the same directory as the bundle. \n The command also includes the name of the Amazon S3 bucket in which the bundle is to be stored; your AWS access key ID; and your AWS secret access key.\n $ ec2-upload-bundle --manifest ./bundled/photon-ami.manifest.xml --bucket  --access-key  --secret-key \n\nRegister the Image\n Run the following command to register the image.

All the packages that Photon builds and publishes reside in the RPMs directory of the ISO when it is mounted. The RPMs directory contains metadata that lets it act as a yum repository. Mounting the ISO gives you all the packages corresponding to a Photon OS build. If, however, you built Photon OS yourself from the source code, the packages correspond only to your build, though they will typically be the latest. In contrast, the ISO that you obtain from the Bintray web site contains only the packages that are in the ISO at the point of publication. As a result, the packages may no longer match those on Bintray, which are updated regularly.  \nThe main Photon OS repository (photon.repo) contains all the packages that are built from the ISO or from another source.

Obtain the source RPMs that Photon OS uses from the  Bintray location, https://bintray.com/vmware/photon\nPrerequisites\n\nTo build a package from its source RPM, or SRPM, Photon OS requires the following packages:  \n\nrpmbuild. This package is installed by default on the full version of Photon OS, so you should not have to install it. \ngcc. This package is also installed by default on the full version of Photon OS, so you should not have to install it. \nmake, Cmake, automake, or another make package, depending on the package you are trying to install and build from its source RPM. Cmake is installed by default on Photon OS. \n  You can install other make packages by using tdnf or yum.  \n\n\n\nA local unprivileged user account other than the root account. You should build RPMs as an unprivileged user. Do not build a package as root becau--building an RPM with the root account might damage your system. \nTake a snapshot of your virtual machine before building the package if you are building a package on a virtual machine running Photon OS in VMware vSphere, VMware Workstation, or VMware Fusion.\n\nProcedure\nVMware recommends that you install and build packages from their source RPMs on the full version of Photon OS. Do not use the minimal version to work with source RPMs.  \nPerfrom the following steps to install and build an example package- sed from its source RPM on Photon OS with an unprivileged account. \n\ncheck whether rpmbuild is installed by running the following command: \n rpmbuild --version\n If it is not installed, install it by running the following command as root: \n tdnf install rpm-build\n\nCreate the directories for building RPMs under your local user account home directory and not under root:\n mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}\n\nCreate a .rpmmacros file under your home directory and override the default location of the RPM building tree with the new one. This command overwrites an existing .rpmmacros file. Before running the following command, make sure you do not already have a .rpmmacros file. If a .rpmmacros file exists, back it up under a new name in case you want to restore it later.    \necho '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros\n\nPlace the source RPM file that you want to install and build in the /tmp directory. \n\nInstall the source file, run the following command with your unprivileged user account, replacing the sed example source RPM with the name of the one that you want to install: \n\n```\nrpm -i /tmp/sed-4.2.2-2.ph1.src.rpm\n```\n\nThe above command unpacks the source RPM and places its `.spec` file in your `~/rpmbuild/SPECS` directory. In the next step, the `rpmbuild` tool uses the `.spec` file to build the RPM. \n\nBuild the RPM, run the following commands with your unprivileged user account. Replace the sed.spec example file with the name of the .spec file that you want to build. \n cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS\n rpmbuild -ba sed.spec\n If successful, the rpmbuild -ba command builds the RPM and generates an RPM package file in your ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64 directory. For example:\n ls RPMS/x86_64/\n sed-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm  sed-debuginfo-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm  sed-lang-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm\n The rpmbuild command also generates a new SRPM file and saves it in your ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS directory. For example:  \n ls SRPMS/\n sed-4.2.2-2.src.rpm\n If the rpmbuild command is unsuccessful with an error that it cannot find a library, you must install the RPMs for the library that your source RPM depends on before you can successfully build your source RPM. Iterate through installing the libraries that your source RPM relies on until you can successfully build it. \n\nTo install the RPM, run the following command with your unprivileged user account:  \nrpm -i RPMS/x86_64/sed-4.2.2-2.x86_64.rpm\n\n\n"},"photon_admin/compiling-c-code-on-the-minimal-version-of-photon-os.html":{"url":"photon_admin/compiling-c-code-on-the-minimal-version-of-photon-os.html","title":"Compiling C++ Code on the Minimal Version of Photon OS","keywords":"","body":"Compiling C++ Code on the Minimal Version of Photon OS\nAs a minimalist Linux run-time environment, the minimal version of Photon OS lacks the packages that you need to compile the code for a C++ program.

The ID, which appears in square brackets, must be one word that is unique amoung the system's repositories; in the example above, it is [lightwave].\nThe baseurl is a URL for the repository's repodata directory. For a repository on a local server that can be accessed directly or mounted as a file system, the base URL can be a file referenced by file://. Example:  \nbaseurl=file:///server/repo/\nThe gpgcheck setting specifies whether to check the GPG signature. The gpgkey setting furnishes the URL for the repository's ASCII-armored GPG key file. Tdnf uses the GPG key to verify a package if its key has not been imported into the RPM database.\nThe enabled setting tells tdnf whether to poll the repository. If enabled is set to 1, tdnf polls it; if it is set to 0, tdnf ignores it. \nThe skip_if_unavailable setting instructs tdnf to continue running if the repository goes offline.\nOther options and variables can appear in the repository file. The variables that are used with some of the options can reduce future changes to the repository configuration files. There are variables to replace the value of the version of the package and to replace the base architecture.

The command can take one of the following arguments: all, available, installed, extras, obsoletes, recent, upgrades. \ntdnf list updates\nThe list of packages might be long. To more easily view it, you can concatenate it into a text file, and then open the text file in a text editor: \ntdnf list all > pkgs.txt\nvi pkgs.txt\nTo list enabled repositories, run the following command:\ntdnf repolist\nmakecache: This command updates the cached binary metadata for all known repositories.

The following is an example: \ntdnf reinstall docker kubernetes\n\nReinstalling:\nkubernetes                            x86_64        1.1.8-1.ph1             152.95 M\ndocker                                x86_64        1.11.0-1.ph1             57.20 M\n\nTotal installed size: 210.15 M\nremove: This command removes a package. When removing a package, tdnf by default also removes dependencies that are no longer used if they were was installed by tdnf as a dependency without being explicitly requested by a user. You can modify the dependency removal by changing the clean_requirements_on_remove option in /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf to false. \ntdnf remove packagename\nsearch: This command searches for the attributes of packages. The argument can be the names of packages. The following is an example: \ntdnf search docker kubernetes\ndocker : Docker\ndocker : Docker\ndocker-debuginfo : Debug information for package docker\ndocker : Docker\nkubernetes : Kubernetes cluster management\nkubernetes : Kubernetes cluster management\nkubernetes-debuginfo : Debug information for package kubernetes\nkubernetes : Kubernetes cluster management\nThe argument of the search command can also be a keyword or a combination of keywords and packages: \ntdnf search terminal bash\nrubygem-terminal-table : Simple, feature rich ascii table generation library\nncurses : Libraries for terminal handling of character screens\nmingetty : A minimal getty program for virtual terminals\nncurses : Libraries for terminal handling of character screens\nncurses : Libraries for terminal handling of character screens\nbash : Bourne-Again SHell\nbash-lang : Additional language files for bash\nbash-lang : Additional language files for bash\nbash : Bourne-Again SHell\nbash-debuginfo : Debug information for package bash\nbash : Bourne-Again SHell\nbash-lang : Additional language files for bash\nupgrade: This command upgrades the package or packages that you specify to an available higher version that tdnf can resolve. If the package is already the latest version, the command returns Nothing to do. The following is an example: \ntdnf upgrade boost\n\nUpgrading:\nboost                                 x86_64        1.60.0-1.ph1              8.11 M\n\nTotal installed size: 8.11 M\nIs this ok [y/N]:y\n\nDownloading:\nboost                                  2785950    100%\nTesting transaction\nRunning transaction\n\nComplete!\nYou can also run the upgrade command with the refresh option to update the cached metadata with the latest information from the repositories. The following example refreshes the metadata and then checks for a new version of tdnf but does not find one, so tdnf takes no action: \ntdnf upgrade tdnf --refresh\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Lightwave 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)Updates'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Extras 1.0(x86_64)'\nRefreshing metadata for: 'VMware Photon Linux 1.0(x86_64)'\nNothing to do.\nupgrade-to: This command upgrades to the version of the package that you specify. EThe following is an example: \ntdnf upgrade-to ruby2.3\nThe commands and options of tdnf are a subset of those of dnf.

By using systemd, Photon OS adopts a contemporary Linux standard to bootstrap the user space and concurrently start services. This is an architecture that differs from traditional Linux systems such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. \nA traditional Linux system contains an initialization system called SysVinit. With SLES 11, for instance, the SysVinit-style init programs control how the system starts up and shuts down. Init implements system runlevels. A SysVinit runlevel defines a state in which a process or service runs. \nIn contrast to a SysVinit system, systemd defines no such runlevels. Instead, systemd uses a dependency tree of targets to determine which services to start when. Combined with the declarative nature of systemd commands, systemd targets reduce the amount of code needed to run a command, leaving you with code that is easier to maintain and probably faster to execute. For an overview of systemd, see systemd System and Service Manager and the man page for systemd.\nOn Photon OS, you must manage services with systemd and systemctl, its command-line utility for inspecting and controlling the system, and not the deprecated commands of init.d. \nFor more information, see the index of all the systemd man pages, including systemctl, at \nhttps://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/\n\nViewing Services\nControlling Services\nCreating a Startup Service\nDisabling the Photon OS httpd.service\nAuditing System Events with auditd\nAnalyzing systemd Logs with journalctl\nMigrating Scripts to systemd\n\n"},"photon_admin/viewing-services.html":{"url":"photon_admin/viewing-services.html","title":"Viewing Services","keywords":"","body":"Viewing Services\nTo view a description of all the loaded and active units, run the systemctl command without any options or arguments: \nsystemctl\nTo see all the loaded, active, and inactive units and their description, run the following command: \nsystemctl --all\nTo see all the unit files and their current status but no description, run thie following command: \nsystemctl list-unit-files\nThe grep command filters the services by a search term, a helpful tactic to recall the exact name of a unit file without looking through a long list of names.

A best practice is to match the exact name of the network interface, which is eth0 in this example. This example file also includes a DNS server for the static IP address. As a result, the configuration sets the UseDNS key to false in the DHCP column so that Photon OS ignores the DHCP server for DNS for this interface.  \ncat > /etc/systemd/network/10-eth0-static-en.network Second, create the .network file for the second network interface, which is eth1 in this example. This configuration file sets the eth1 interface to an IP address from DHCP and sets DHCP as the source for DNS lookups. Setting the DHCP key to yes acquires an IP address for IPv4 and IPv6. To acquire an IP address for IPv4 only, set the DHCP key to ipv4.\ncat > /etc/systemd/network/50-eth1-dhcp-en.network "},"photon_admin/combining-dhcp-and-static-ip-addresses-with-ipv4-and-ipv6.html":{"url":"photon_admin/combining-dhcp-and-static-ip-addresses-with-ipv4-and-ipv6.html","title":"Combining DHCP and Static IP Addresses with IPv4 and IPv6","keywords":"","body":"Combining DHCP and Static IP Addresses with IPv4 and IPv6\nYou can combine DHCP and static IP addresses with both IPv4 and IPv6. \nExamples\nThe following example shows how to use DHCP to allocate both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:\n[Network]\nDHCP=yes\nThe following example shows how to use DHCP to allocate only IPv4 addresses:\n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv4\nThe following example shows how to use DHCP to allocate only IPv6 addresses:\n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv6\nThe following example shows how to use DHCP for IPv4 addresses and static IP addresses for IPv6 addresses: \n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv4\nAddress=fd00::1/48\nGateway=fd00::252\nThe following example shows how to use DHCP for IPv6 addresses and static IP addresses for IPv4: \n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv6\nAddress=10.10.10.1/24\nGateway=10.10.10.253\nThe following example shows how to use static IP addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6: \n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv6\nAddress=10.10.10.1/24\nGateway=10.10.10.253\nAddress=fd00::1/48\nGateway=fd00::252\n"},"photon_admin/clearing-the-machine-id-of-a-cloned-instance-for-dhcp.html":{"url":"photon_admin/clearing-the-machine-id-of-a-cloned-instance-for-dhcp.html","title":"Clearing the Machine ID of a Cloned Instance for DHCP","keywords":"","body":"Clearing the Machine ID of a Cloned Instance for DHCP\nPhoton OS uses the contents of /etc/machine-id to determine the DHCP unique identifier (duid) that is used for DHCP requests.

For example, a device named eth2 might become eth1 after you remove a NIC and restart the machine.\nYou can prevent interface names from reordering by turning on predictable network interface names. The naming schemes that Photon OS uses can then assign fixed, predictable names to network interfaces even after you add or remove cards or other firmware and the restart the system. \nWhen you enable predictable network interface names, you can use one of the following options to assign persistent names to network interfaces:\n\nApply the slot name policy to set the name of networking devices in the ens format with a statically assigned PCI slot number.\nApply the mac name policy to set the name of networking devices in the enx format a unique MAC address. \nApply the path name policy to set the name of networking devices in the enpXsY format derived from a device connector's physical location.\n\nThough Photon OS supports the onboard name policy to set the name of networking devices from index numbers given by the firmware in the eno format, the policy might result in nonpersistent names. \nThe option to choose depends on your use case and your unique networking requirements. For example, when you clone virtual machines and require the MAC addresses to be different from one another but the interface name to be the same, consider using ens to keep the slot the same after system reboots. \nAlternatively, if the cloning function supports enx, you can use it to set a MAC address which persists after reboots. \nPerform the following steps to turn on predictable network interface names: \n\nMake a backup copy of the following file in case you need to restore it later:\n cp /boot/grub/grub.cfg /boot/grub/grub.cfg.original\n\nTo turn on predictable network interface names, edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg to remove the following string: \n\n\n```\nnet.ifnames=0Item\n```\nThe string appears near the bottom of the file in the `menuentry` section:\n\n\n```\nmenuentry \"Photon\" {\n   linux \"/boot/\"$photon_linux root=$rootpartition net.ifnames=0 $photon_cmdline\n   if [ \"$photon_initrd\" ]; then\n        initrd \"/boot/\"$photon_initrd\n   fi\n}\n# End /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n```\n\nEdit out `net.ifnames=0`, but make no other changes to the file, and then save it. \n\nSpecify the types of policies that you want to use for predictable interface names by modifying the NamePolicy option in /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link. The file contents are as follows: \n\n```\ncat /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n[Link]\nNamePolicy=kernel database\nMACAddressPolicy=persistent\n\n```\nTo use the ens or enx option, the slot policy or the mac policy can be added to the space-separated list of policies that follow the NamePolicy option in the default link file, /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link. The order of the policies matters. Photon OS applies the policy listed first before proceeding to the next policy if the first one fails. \nFor example: \n/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link\n    [Link]\n    NamePolicy=slot mac kernel database\n    MACAddressPolicy=persistent\nWith the name policy specified in the above example, you might still have an Ethernet-style interface name if the two previous policies, slot and mac, fail. \nFor information on setting name policies, see systemd.link--network device configuration. \n"},"photon_admin/inspecting-the-status-of-network-links-with-networkctl.html":{"url":"photon_admin/inspecting-the-status-of-network-links-with-networkctl.html","title":"Inspecting the Status of Network Links with networkctl","keywords":"","body":"Checking the Status of Network Links with networkctl\nYou can inspect information about network connections by using the networkctl command.

Metadata typically includes the instance ID and the local host name. \nThe user data contains the commands and scripts that Photon OS executes when it starts in the cloud. The user data commonly takes the form of a shell script or a YAML file containing a cloud configuration. The cloud-init overview and cloud-init documentation contains information about the types of data sources and the formats for metadata and user data. \nOn Photon OS, cloud-init is enabled and running by default.

Here's an example: \ntouch newfile.md\nstat newfile.md\n  File: 'newfile.md'\n  Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file\nDevice: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316454      Links: 1\nAccess: (0640/-rw-r-----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nWhen you create a directory as root, Photon OS sets the permissions to 0750:\nmkdir newdir\nstat newdir\n  File: 'newdir'\n  Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory\nDevice: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316455      Links: 2\nAccess: (0750/drwxr-x---)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nBecause the mkdir command uses the umask to modify the permissions placed on newly created files or directories, you can see umask at work in the permissions of the new directory. Its default permissions are set at 0750 after the umask subtracts 0027 from the full set of open permissions, 0777.\nSimilarly, a new file begins as 0666 if you were to set umask to 0000. But because umask is set by default to 0027, a new file's permissions are set to 0640. \nSo be aware of the default permissions on the directories and files that you create. Some system services and applications might require permissions other than the default. The systemd network service, for example, requires user-defined configuration files to be set to 644, not the default of 640. Thus, after you create a network configuration file with a .network extension, you must run the chmod command to set the new file's mode bits to 644. For example: \nchmod 644 10-static-en.network \nFor more information on permissions, see the man pages for stat, umask, and acl.\n"},"photon_admin/disabling-tls-1.0.html":{"url":"photon_admin/disabling-tls-1.0.html","title":"Disabling TLS 1.0 to Improve Transport Layer Security","keywords":"","body":"Disabling TLS 1.0 to Improve Transport Layer Security\nPhoton OS includes GnuTLS to help secure the transport layer. GnuTLS is a library that implements the SSL and TLS protocols to secure communications. \nOn Photon OS, SSL 3.0, which contains a known vulnerability, is disabled by default. \nHowever, TLS 1.0, which also contains known vulnerabilities, is enabled by default.\nTo turn off TLS 1.0, perform the follwoing steps:\n\nCreate a directory named /etc/gnutls.\nIn /etc/gnutls create a file named default-priorities.\nIn the default-priorities file, specify GnuTLS priority strings that remove TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 but retain TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2.\nAfter adding a new default-priorities file or after modifying it, you must restart all applications, including SSH, with an open TLS session for the changes to take effect.  \n\nThe following is an example of a default-priorities file that contains GnuTLS priorities to disable TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0:  \ncat /etc/gnutls/default-priorities\nSYSTEM=NONE:!VERS-SSL3.0:!VERS-TLS1.0:+VERS-TLS1.1:+VERS-TLS1.2:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL\nIn this example, the priority string imposes system-specific policies. The NONE keyword means that no algorithms, protocols, or compression methods are enabled, so that you can enable specific versions individually later in the string. The priority string then specifies that SSL version 3.0 and TLS version 1.0 be removed, as marked by the exclamation point. The priority string then enables, as marked by the plus sign, versions 1.1 and 1.2 of TLS. The cypher is AES-128-CBC. The key exchange is RSA. The MAC is SHA1. And the compression algorithm is COMP-NULL.\nOn Photon OS, you can verify the system-specific policies in the default-priorities file as follows:\n\nConcatenate the default-priorities file to check its contents: \nroot@photon-rc [ ~ ]# cat /etc/gnutls/default-priorities\n SYSTEM=NONE:!VERS-SSL3.0:!VERS-TLS1.0:+VERS-TLS1.1:+VERS-TLS1.2:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL\n\nRun the following command to check the protocols that are enabled for the system:     \n root@photon-rc [ /etc/gnutls ]# gnutls-cli --priority @SYSTEM -l\n Cipher suites for @SYSTEM\n TLS_RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA1                                0x00, 0x2f      SSL3.0\n\n Certificate types: none\n Protocols: VERS-TLS1.1, VERS-TLS1.2\n Compression: COMP-NULL\n Elliptic curves: none\n PK-signatures: none\n\n\nFor information about the GnuTLS priority strings, see https://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html.\nFor information about the vulnerability in SSL 3.0, see SSL 3.0 Protocol Vulnerability and POODLE Attack.\nFor information about the vulnerabilities in TLS 1.0, see Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations.\n"},"photon_user/":{"url":"photon_user/","title":"User Guide","keywords":"","body":"User Guide\nThe Photon OS User Guide provides information about how to use Photon OS as a developer. \nThe User Guide covers the basics of setting up a Network PXE Boot Server, working with Kickstart and Kubernetes, mounting remote file systems, and installing and using Lightwave. \nProduct version: 3.0\nThis documentation applies to all 3.0.x releases.\nIntended Audiences\nThis information is intended for Photon OS developers who use Photon OS.\n\nCopyright © 2016-2019 VMware, Inc.

You can set the variables through command line or a JSON file.\nSet the following variables:\n- `iso_file` - The photon ISO for the build. This file can be local or remote.\n- `iso_sha1sum` – The SHA1 sum of the ISO you want to build.\n- `product_version` - The Photon OS release version that you want to build. This version is added to the image filename. \nPreset JSON files with the required parameters are located in the photon-packer-templates/vars folder.\nKick Start Build\nTo kick start a build using the JSON file, run the following command:\npacker build -var-file=vars/iso-3.0GA.json packer-photon.json\nTo build Photon OS manually, run the following:\npacker build \\\n        -var 'iso_file=http://dl.bintray.com/vmware/photon/3.0/GA/iso/photon-3.0-26156e2.iso' \\\n        -var 'iso_sha1sum=1c38dd6d00e11d3cbf7768ce93fc3eb8913a9673' \\\n        -var 'product_version=3.0GA' \\\n        packer-photon.json\nBuild VMware Workstation or Fusion Vagrant Box\nTo build only a VMware Workstation or Fusion vagrant box, run:\npacker build -only=vagrant-vmware_desktop

With SLES 11, for instance, SysVinit-style init programs control how the system starts up and shuts down. Init implements system runlevels. A SysVinit runlevel defines a state in which a process or service runs. In contrast to a SysVinit system, systemd defines no such runlevels. Instead, systemd uses a dependency tree of targets to determine which services to start when.\nBecause the systemd commands differ from those of an init.d-based Linux system, a section later in this guide illustrates how to troubleshoot by using systemctl commands instead of init.d-style commands. \nTdnf keeps the operating system as small as possible while preserving yum's robust package-management capabilities. On Photon OS, tdnf is the default package manager for installing new packages. Since troubleshooting with tdnf differs from using yum, a later section of this guide describes how to solve problems with packages and repositories by using tdnf commands.\n"},"photon_troubleshoot/root-account-sudo-and-su-commands.html":{"url":"photon_troubleshoot/root-account-sudo-and-su-commands.html","title":"The Root Account and the sudo and su Commands","keywords":"","body":"The Root Account and the sudo and su Commands\nThe Troubleshooting Guide assumes that you are logged in to Photon OS with the root account and running commands as root.

Ss   07:51   0:32 /lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 22\nnetstat\nThe netstat command can identify bottlenecks causing  performance issues. It lists network connections, listening sockets, port information, and interface statistics for different protocols. Examples: \nnetstat --statistics\nnetstat --listening\nfind\nUse the find command to troubleshoot a Photon OS machine that has stopped working. The following command lists the files in the root directory that have changed in the past day: \n    find / -mtime -1 \nSee the find manual. Take note of the security considerations listed in the find manual if you are using find to troubleshoot an appliance running on Photon OS. \nlocate\nThe locate command is a fast way to find files and directories you onlay have a keyword. This command is similar to find and part of the same findutils package preinstalled on the full version of Photon OS by default. It finds file names in the file names database. \nBefore you can use locate accurately, update its database: \nupdatedb\nThen run locate to quickly find a file, such as any file name containing .network, which can be helpful to see all the system's .network configuration files. The following is an abridged example: \nlocate .network\n/etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.freedesktop.network1.conf\n/etc/systemd/network/10-dhcp-en.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-host0.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/network/80-container-ve.network\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/busnames.target.wants/org.freedesktop.network1.busname\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/org.freedesktop.network1.busnname\n/usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.network1.service\nThe locate command is also a quick way to see whether a troubleshooting tool is installed on Photon OS. Examples: \nlocate strace\n/usr/bin/strace\n/usr/bin/strace-graph\n/usr/bin/strace-log-merge\n/usr/share/man/man1/strace.1.gz\n/usr/share/vim/vim74/syntax/strace.vim\n\nlocate traceroute\nIn this example, the strace tool is installed but traceroute is not. \nYou can install traceroute from the Photon OS repository: \ntdnf install traceroute\ndf\nThe df command reports the disk space available on the file system. Running out of disk space can lead an application to fail and a quick check of the available space makes sense as an early troubleshooting step: \ndf -h\nThe -h option prints out the available and used space in human-readable sizes. After checking the space, you should also check the number of available inodes. Too few available inodes can lead to difficult-to-diagnose problems:\ndf -i\nmd5sum\nThe md5sum tool calculates 128-bit RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message Digest Algorithm hashes (a message digest, or digital signature, of a file) to uniquely identify a file and verify its integrity after file transfers, downloads, or disk errors when the security of the file is not in question. \nmd5sum can help troubleshooting installation issues by verifying that the version of Photon OS being installed matches the version on the Bintray download page. If, for instance, bytes were dropped during the download, the checksums will not match. Try downloading it again.\nsha256sum\nThe sha256sum tool calculates the authenticity of a file to prevent tampering when security is a concern. Photon OS also includes shasum, sha1sum, sha384sum, and sha512sum. See the man pages for  md3sum, sha256sum, and the other SHA utilities. \nstrace\nThe strace utility follows system calls and signals as they are executed so that you can see what an application, command, or process is doing. strace can trace failed commands, identify where a process obtains its configuration, monitor file activity, and find the location of a crash. \nBy tracing system calls, strace can help troubleshoot a broad range of problems, including issues with input-output, memory, interprocess communication, network usage, and application performance. \nFor troubleshooting a problem that gives off few or no clues, the following command displays every system call: \nstrace ls -al\nWith strace commands, you can route the output to a file to make it easier to analyze: \nstrace -o output.txt ls -al\nstrace can reveal the files that an application tries to open with the -eopen option. This combination can help troubleshoot an application that is failing because it is missing files or being denied access to a file it needs. If, for example, you see \"No such file or directory\" in the results of strace -eopen, something might be wrong: \nstrace -eopen sshd\nopen(\"/usr/lib/x86_64/libpam.so.0\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nopen(\"/usr/lib/libpam.so.0\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nThe results above indicate that the first file is missing because it is found in the next line. In other cases, the application might be unable to open one of its configuration files or it might be reading the wrong one. If the results say \"permission denied\" for one of the files, check the permissions of the file with ls -l or stat.   \nWhen troubleshooting with strace, you can include the process ID in its commands. Here's an example of how to find a process ID: \nps -ef | grep apache\nYou can then use strace to examine the file a process is working with: \nstrace -e trace=file -p 1719\nA similar command can trace network traffic: \nstrace -p 812 -e trace=network\nIf an application is crashing, use strace to trace the application and then analyze what happens right before the application crashes.\nYou can also trace the child processes that an application spawns with the fork system call, and you can do so with systemctl commands that start a process to identify why an application crashes immediately or fails to start: \nstrace -f -o output.txt systemctl start httpd\nExample: If journalctl is showing that networkd is failing, you can run strace to troubleshoot: \nstrace -o output.txt systemctl restart systemd-networkd\nThen grep inside the results for something, such as exit or error: \ngrep exit output.txt\nIf the results indicate systemd-resolved is going wrong, you can then strace it: \nstrace -f -o output.txt systemctl restart systemd-resolved\nfile\nThe file command determines the file type, which can help troubleshoot problems when an application mistakes one type of file for another, leading it to errors. Example: \nfile /usr/sbin/sshd\n/usr/sbin/sshd: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, stripped\nstat\nThe stat command can help troubleshoot problems with files or the file system by showing the last date it was modified and other information. Example:  \nstat /dev/sda1\nFile: '/dev/sda1'\nSize: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   block special file\nDevice: 6h/6d   Inode: 6614        Links: 1     Device type: 8,1\nAccess: (0660/brw-rw----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    8/    disk)\nAccess: 2016-09-02 12:23:56.135999936 +0000\nModify: 2016-09-02 12:23:52.879999981 +0000\nChange: 2016-09-02 12:23:52.879999981 +0000\nBirth: -\nOn Photon OS, stat is handy to show permissions for a file or directory in both their absolute octal notation and their read-write-execute abbreviation; truncated example: \nchmod 777 tester.md\nstat tester.md\n  File: 'tester.md'\n  Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file\nDevice: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316385      Links: 1\nAccess: (0777/-rwxrwxrwx)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nwatch\nThe watch utility runs a command at regular intervals so you can observe how its output changes over time. watch can help dynamically monitor network links, routes, and other information when you are troubleshooting networking or performance issues. Examples: \nwatch -n0 --differences ss\nwatch -n1 --differences ip route\nThe following is an example with a screenshot of the output. This command monitors the traffic on your network links. The highlighted numbers are updated every second so you can see the traffic fluctuating: \nwatch -n1 --differences ip -s link show up\n  \nvmstat and fdisk\nThe vmstat tool displays statistics about virtual memory, processes, block input-output, disks, and CPU activity. This tool can help diagnose performance problems, especially system bottlenecks.  \nIts output on a Photon OS virtual machine running in VMware Workstation 12 Pro without a heavy load looks like this: \nvmstat\nprocs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----\n r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st\n 0  0      0   5980  72084 172488    0    0    27    44  106  294  1  0 98  1  0\nThese codes are explained in the vmstat man page. \n- If `r`, the number of runnable processes, is higher than 10, the machine is under stress; consider intervening to reduce the number of processes or to distribute some of the processes to other machines. In other words, the machine has a bottleneck in executing processes.\n- If `cs`, the number of context switches per second, is really high, there may be too many jobs running on the machine.\n- If `in`, the number of interrupts per second, is relatively high, there might be a bottleneck for network or disk IO.\nYou can investigate disk IO further by using vmstat's -d option to report disk statistics. The following is an abridged example on a machine with little load: \nvmstat -d\ndisk- ------------reads------------ ------------writes----------- -----IO------\n       total merged sectors      ms  total merged sectors      ms    cur    sec\nram0       0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nram1       0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nloop0      0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nloop1      0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nsr0        0      0       0       0      0      0       0       0      0      0\nsda    22744    676  470604   12908  72888  24949  805224  127692      0    130\nThe -D option summarizes disk statistics:\nvmstat -D\n           26 disks\n            2 partitions\n        22744 total reads\n          676 merged reads\n       470604 read sectors\n        12908 milli reading\n        73040 writes\n        25001 merged writes\n       806872 written sectors\n       127808 milli writing\n            0 inprogress IO\n          130 milli spent IO\nYou can also get statistics about a partition. First, run the fdisk -l command to list the machine's devices. Then run vmstat -p with the name of a device to view its stats: \nfdisk -l\nDisk /dev/ram0: 4 MiB, 4194304 bytes, 8192 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\n...\nDevice        Start      End  Sectors Size Type\n/dev/sda1      2048 16771071 16769024   8G Linux filesystem\n/dev/sda2  16771072 16777182     6111   3M BIOS boot\n\nvmstat -p /dev/sda1\nsda1          reads   read sectors  writes    requested writes\n               22579     473306      78510     866088\nSee the vmstat man page for more options. \nlsof\nThe lsof command lists open files. The tool's definition of an open file  includes directories, libraries, streams, domain sockets, and Internet sockets. THis enables it to identify the files a process is using. Because a Linux system like Photon OS uses files to do its work, you can run lsof as root to see how the system is using them and to see how an application works. \nIf you cannot unmount a disk because it is in use, you can run lsof to identify the files on the disk that are being used. \nThe following is an example that shows the processes that are using the root directory: \nlsof /root\nCOMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF   NODE NAME\nbash       879 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nbash      1265 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nsftp-serv 1326 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\ngdb       1351 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nbash      1395 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nlsof      1730 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 262159 /root\nYou can do the same with an application or virtual appliance by running lsof with the user name or process ID of the app. The following example lists the open files used by the Apache HTTP Server:  \nlsof -u apache\nRunning the command with the -i option lists all the open network and Internet files, which can help troubleshoot network problems: \nlsof -i\nSee the Unix socket addresses of a user like zookeeper: \nlsof -u zookeeper -U\nThe following example shows the processes running on Ports 1 through 80:\nlsof -i TCP:1-80\nCOMMAND  PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nhttpd    403   root    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd    407 apache    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd    408 apache    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd    409 apache    3u  IPv6  10733      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nsshd     820   root    3u  IPv4  11336      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)\nsshd     820   root    4u  IPv6  11343      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)\nsshd    1258   root    3u  IPv4  48040      0t0  TCP 198.51.100.143:ssh->198.51.100.1:49759 (ESTABLISHED)\nsshd    1319   root    3u  IPv4  50866      0t0  TCP 198.51.100.143:ssh->198.51.100.1:51054 (ESTABLISHED)\nsshd    1388   root    3u  IPv4  56438      0t0  TCP 198.51.100.143:ssh->198.51.100.1:60335 (ESTABLISHED)\nYou can also inspect the files opened by a process ID. The following example queries the files open by the systemd network service: \nlsof -p 1917\nCOMMAND    PID            USER   FD      TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF   NODE NAME\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network  cwd       DIR                8,1     4096      2 /\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network  txt       REG                8,1   887896 272389 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network  mem       REG                8,1   270680 262267 /usr/lib/libnss_files-2.22.so\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    0r      CHR                1,3      0t0   5959 /dev/null\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    1u     unix 0x0000000000000000      0t0  45734 type=STREAM\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    3u  netlink                         0t0   6867 ROUTE\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    4u     unix 0x0000000000000000      0t0  45744 type=DGRAM\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network    9u  netlink                         0t0  45754 KOBJECT_UEVENT\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network   12u  a_inode               0,11        0   5955 [timerfd]\nsystemd-n 1917 systemd-network   13u     IPv4             104292      0t0    UDP 198.51.100.143:bootpc\nfuser\nThe fuser command identifies the process IDs of processes using files or sockets. The term process is, in this case, synonymous with user. To identify the process ID of a process using a socket, run fuser with its namespace option and specify tcp or udp and the name of the process or port. Examples: \nfuser -n tcp ssh\nssh/tcp:               940  1308\nfuser -n tcp http\nhttp/tcp:              592   594   595   596\nfuser -n tcp 80\n80/tcp:                592   594   595   596\nldd\nBy revealing the shared libraries that a program depends on, ldd can help troubleshoot an application that is missing a library or finding the wrong one.\nFor example, if you get a \"file not found\" output, check the path to the library.  \nldd /usr/sbin/sshd\nlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc0e3e3000)\nlibpam.so.0 => (file not found)\nlibcrypto.so.1.0.0 => /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 (0x00007f624e570000)\nYou can also use the objdump command to show dependencies for a program's object files; example:\nobjdump -p /usr/sbin/sshd | grep NEEDED\ngdb\nThe gdb tool is the GNU debugger. It lets you see inside a program while it executes or when it crashes so that you can catch errors as they occur. The gdb tool is typically used to debug programs written in C and C++. On Photon OS, gdb can help you determine why an application crashed. See the man page for gdb for instructions on how to run it. \nFor an extensive example on how to use gdb to troubleshoot Photon OS running on a VM when you cannot login to Photon OS, see the section on troubleshooting boot and logon problems. \n"},"photon_troubleshoot/default-tools.html":{"url":"photon_troubleshoot/default-tools.html","title":"Troubleshooting Tools Installed by Default","keywords":"","body":"Troubleshooting Tools Installed by Default\nThe following troubleshooting tools are included in the full version of Photon OS: \n\ngrep.

The procedure in this section assumes that the virtual machine running Photon OS is functioning normally. \nThe process to use this troubleshooting method varies by environment. The examples in this section assume that the troublesome Photon OS virtual machine is running in VMware Workstation 12 Pro on a Microsoft Windows 8 Enterprise host. The examples also use an additional, fully functional Photon OS virtual machine running in Workstation.\nYou can use other hosts, hypervisors, and operating systems--but you will have to adapt the example process below to them. Directory paths, file names, and other aspects might be different on other systems. \n\nPrerequisites\nProcedure Overview\nProcedure\n\nPrerequisites\nVerify that you have the following resources: \n\nRoot access to a Linux machine other than the one you are troubleshooting. It can be another Photon OS machine, Ubuntu, or another Linux variant. \nThe vmss2core utility from VMware. It is installed by default in VMware Workstation and some other VMware products. If your system doesn't already contain it, you can download it for free from https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vmss2core.\nA local copy of the Photon OS ISO of the exact same version and release number as the Photon OS machine that you are troubleshooting. \n\nProcedure Overview\nThe process to apply this troubleshooting method is as follows:\n\nOn a local computer, you open a file on the Photon OS ISO that contains Linux debugging information. Then you suspend the troublesome Photon OS VM and extract the kernel memory logs from the VMware hypervisor running Photon OS.\nNext, you use the vmss2core tool to convert the memory logs into core dump files. The vmss2core utility converts VMware checkpoint state files into formats that third-party debugging tools understand. It can handle both suspend (.vmss) and snapshot (.vmsn) checkpoint state files (hereafter referred to as a vmss file) as well as monolithic and non-monolithic (separate .vmem file) encapsulation of checkpoint state data. See Debugging Virtual Machines with the Checkpoint to Core Tool.\nFinally, you prepare to run the gdb tool by using the debug info file from the ISO to create a .gdbinit file, which you can then analyze with the gdb shell on your local Linux machine.\n\nAll three components must be in the same directory on a Linux machine.  \nProcedure\n\nObtain a local copy of the Photon OS ISO of the exact same version and release number as the Photon OS machine that you are troubleshooting and mount the ISO on a Linux machine (or open it on a Windows machine):\nmount /mnt/cdrom\n\nLocate the following file. (If you opened the Photon OS ISO on a Windows computer, copy the following file to the root folder of a Linux machine.)\n/RPMS/x86_64/linux-debuginfo-4.4.8-6.ph1.x86_64.rpm\n\nOn a Linux machine, run the following rpm2cpio command to convert the RPM file to a cpio file and to extract the contents of the RPM to the current directory:\n rpm2cpio /mnt/cdrom/RPMS/x86_64/linux-debuginfo-4.4.8-6.ph1.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv\n\nFrom the extracted files, copy the following file to your current directory:\n cp usr/lib/debug/lib/modules/4.4.8/vmlinux-4.4.8.debug\n\nRun the following command to download the dmesg functions that will help extract the kernel log from the coredump: \n wget https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kdump/gdbmacros.txt\n wget https://github.com/vmware/photon/blob/master/tools/scripts/gdbmacros-for-linux.txt\n\nMove the file as follows:\n mv gdbmacros-for-linux.txt .gdbinit\n\nSwitch to your host machine so you can get the kernel memory files from the VM. Suspend the troublesome VM and locate the .vmss and .vmem files in the virtual machine's directory on the host. \n Example:\n C:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit (7)>dir\n      Volume in drive C is Windows\n      Directory of C:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit\n      (7)\n     09/20/2016  12:22 PM              .\n     09/20/2016  12:22 PM              ..\n     09/19/2016  03:39 PM       402,653,184 VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmem\n     09/20/2016  12:11 PM         5,586,907 VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmss\n     09/20/2016  12:11 PM     1,561,001,984 VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-s001.vmdk\n     ...\n     09/20/2016  12:11 PM           300,430 vmware.log\n     ...\n\nNow that you have located the .vmss and .vmem files, convert them to one or more core dump files by using the vmss2core tool that comes with Workstation. Here is an example of how to run the command. Be careful with your pathing, escaping, file names, and so forth--all of which might be different from this example on your Windows machine.\n\n     C:\\Users\\shoenisch\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit (7)>C:\\\"Program Files (x86)\\VMware\\VMware Workstation\"\\vmss2core.exe \"VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmss\" \"VMware Photon 64-bit (7)-f6b070cd.vmem\"\n\n The result of this command is one or more files with a `.core` extension plus a digit. Truncated example: \n\n     C:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit (7)>dir\n      Directory of C:\\Users\\tester\\Documents\\Virtual Machines\\VMware Photon 64-bit(7)\n     09/20/2016  12:22 PM       729,706,496 vmss.core0\n\nCopy the .core file or files to the your current directory on the Linux machine where you so that you can analyze it with gdb.\n Run the following gdb command to enter the gdb shell attached to the memory core dump file. You might have to change the name of the vmss.core file in the example to match your .core file:\n\n\ngdb vmlinux-4.4.8.debug vmss.core0\n\n    GNU gdb (GDB) 7.8.2\n    Copyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n    License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later \n    This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it. \n    There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law. ...\n    Type \"show configuration\" for configuration details.\n    For bug reporting instructions, please see:\n    .\n    Find the GDB manual and other documentation resources online at: .\n    For help, type \"help\".\n    Type \"apropos word\" to search for commands related to \"word\"...\n    Reading symbols from vmlinux-4.4.8.debug...done.\n    warning: core file may not match specified executable file.\n    [New LWP 12345]\n    Core was generated by `GuestVM'.\n    Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n    #0  0xffffffff813df39a in insb (count=0, addr=0xffffc90000144000, port=)\n        at arch/x86/include/asm/io.h:316\n    316     arch/x86/include/asm/io.h: No such file or directory.\n    (gdb)\nResult \nIn the results above, the (gdb) of the last line is the prompt of the gdb shell.

You must also create a VProbes script on the ESXi host, but you can do that after the error. \nThe method is useful in analyzing kernel issues when testing an application or appliance that is running on Photon OS.   \nThere are two similar ways in which you can replicate the Photon OS kernel logs on ESXi by using VProbes. \n\nThe first modifies the VProbes script so that it works only for the VM that you set. It uses a hard-coded address.\n\nThe second uses an abstraction instead of a hard-coded address so that the same VProbes script can be used for any VM on an ESXi host that you have enabled for VProbe and copied its kernel symbol table (kallsyms) to ESXi.\n\n\nFor more information on VMware VProbes, see VProbes: Deep Observability Into the ESXi Hypervisor and the VProbes Programming Reference.\nUsing VProbes Script with a Hard-Coded Address\nPerform the following steps to set a VProbe for an individual VM: \n\nPower off the VM so that you can turn on the VProbe facility. \n Edit the .vmx configuration file for the VM. The file resides in the directory that contains the VM in the ESXi data store. Add the following line of code to the .vmx file and then power the VM on:\n vprobe.enable = \"TRUE\"\n When you edit the .vmx file to add the above line of code, you must first turn off the VM--otherwise, your changes will not persist. \n\nObtain the kernel log_store function address by connecting to the VM with SSH and running the following commands as root. \n Photon OS uses the kptr_restrict setting to place restrictions on the kernel addresses exposed through /proc and other interfaces. This setting hides exposed kernel pointers to prevent attackers from exploiting kernel write vulnerabilities. When you are done using VProbes, you should return kptr_restrict to the original setting of 2 by rebooting.)\n echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict\n grep log_store /proc/kallsyms\n The output of the grep command will look similar to the following string. The first set of characters (without the t) is the log_store function address:\n ffffffff810bb680 t log_store\n\nConnect to the ESXi host with SSH so that you can create a VProbes script. \n Below is the template for the script. log_store in the first line is a placeholder for the VM's log_store function address:\n GUEST:ENTER:log_store {\n            string dst;\n            getgueststr(dst, getguest(RSP+16) & 0xff, getguest(RSP+8));\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", dst);\n         }\n On the ESXi host, create a new file, add the template to it, and then change log_store to the function address that was the output from the grep command on the VM. \n\nAdd a 0x prefix to the function address. In this example, the modified template looks like this:\n GUEST:ENTER:0xffffffff810bb680 {\n        string dst;\n        getgueststr(dst, getguest(RSP+16) & 0xff, getguest(RSP+8));\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", dst);\n     }\n\nSave your VProbes script as console.emt in the /tmp directory. (The file extension for VProbe scripts is .emt.)\n While still connected to the ESXi host with SSH, run the following command to obtain the ID of the virtual machine that you want to troubleshoot: \n vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms\n This command lists all the VMs running on the ESXi host. Find the VM you want to troubleshoot in the list and make a note of its ID. \n\nRun the following command to print all the kernel messages from Photon OS in your SSH console; replace  with the ID of your VM:\n vprobe -m  /tmp/console.emt\n When you're done, type Ctrl-C to stop the loop. \n\n\nA Reusable VProbe Script Using the kallsyms File\nPerform the following steps to create one VProbe script and use for all the VMs on your ESXi host. \n\nPower off the VM and turn on the VProbe facility on each VM that you want to be able to analyze. \n Add vprobe.enable = \"TRUE\" to the VM's .vmx configuration file. See the instructions above.\n\nPower on the VM, connect to it with SSH, and run the following command as root:\n`echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict`\n\nConnect to the ESXi host with SSH to create the following VProbes script and save it as /tmp/console.emt:\n GUEST:ENTER:log_store {\n        string dst;\n        getgueststr(dst, getguest(RSP+16) & 0xff, getguest(RSP+8));\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", dst);\n     }\n\nFrom the ESXi host, run the following command to copy the VM's kallysms file to the tmp directory on the ESXi host:\n`scp root@:/proc/kallsyms /tmp`\n While still connected to the ESXi host with SSH, run the following command to obtain the ID of the virtual machine that you want to troubleshoot: \n `vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms`\n This command lists all the VMs running on the ESXi host. Find the VM you want to troubleshoot in the list and make a note of its ID. \n\nRun the following command to print all the kernel messages from Photon OS in your SSH console.\n Replace  with the ID of your VM. When you're done, type Ctrl-C to stop the loop.\n vprobe -m  -k /tmp/kallysyms /tmp/console.emt\n You can use a directory other than tmp if you want.\n\n\n\n"},"photon_troubleshoot/performance-issues.html":{"url":"photon_troubleshoot/performance-issues.html","title":"Performance Issues","keywords":"","body":"Performance Issues\nPerformance issues can be difficult to troubleshoot because so many variables play a role in overall system performance. Interpreting performance data often depends on the context and the situation. To better identify and isolate variables and to gain insight into performance data, you can use the troubleshooting tools on Photon OS to diagnose the system.  \nIf you have no indication what the cause of a performance degradation might be, start by getting a high-level picture of the system's state. Then look for signs in the data that might point to a cause. \nUse the following guidelines to gain insight into performance data:\n\nStart with the systemd journal.\n\nThe top tool can unmask problems caused by processes or applications overconsuming CPUs, time, or RAM. If the percent of CPU utilization is consistently high with little idle time, for example, there might be a runaway process. Restart it.\n\nThe netstat --statistics command can identify bottlenecks causing performance issues. It lists interface statistics for different protocols.\n\nIf top and netstat reveal no errors, run the strace ls -al to view every system call.\n\nThe watch command can help dynamically monitor a command to help troubleshoot performance issues:\n  watch -n0 --differences \n  You can also combine watch with the vmstat command to dig deeper into statistics about virtual memory, processes, block input-output, disks, and CPU activity. Are there any bottlenecks?\n\nYou can use the dstat utility to see the live, running list of statistics about system resources.\n\nThe systemd-analyze reveals performance statistics for boot time and can help troubleshoot slow system boots and incorrect unit files.\n\n\nThe additional tools that you select depend on the clues that your initial investigation reveals. The following tools can also help troubleshoot performance: sysstat, sar, systemtap, and crash. \n"}}}
