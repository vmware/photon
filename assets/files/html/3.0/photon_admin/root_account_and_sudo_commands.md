# The Root Account and the `sudo` and `su` Commands

The *Photon OS Administration Guide* assumes that you are logged in to Photon OS with the root account and running commands as root. The `sudo` program contains the full version of Photon OS. 

On the minimal version, you must install `sudo` with tdnf if you want to use it. As an alternative to installing `sudo`, to run commands that require root privileges you can switch users as needed with the `su` command.
