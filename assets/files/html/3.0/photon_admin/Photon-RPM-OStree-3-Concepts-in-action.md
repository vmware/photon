# Concepts in Action

Now that we have a fresh installed host (either as [[default|Photon-RPM-OSTree:-2-Installing-a-host-against-default-server-repository]] or [[custom|Photon-RPM-OSTree:-7-Installing-a-host-against-a-custom-server-repository]]), I can explain better the OStree concepts and see them in action.  

## Querying the deployed filetrees

The first thing to do is to run a command that tells us what is installed on the machine and when. Since it's a fresh install from the CD, there is only one bootable filetree image deployed.
``` 
root@photon-host [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree status
  * ostree://photon:photon/3.0/x86_64/minimal
                   Version: 3.0_minimal (2019-08-29T11:20:19Z)
                    Commit: a31a843985e314a9e70bcf09afe8d59f7351817d9fb743c2b6dab84f20833650
```  
## Bootable filetree version

**3.0_minimal** is not the Linux Photon OS release version, nor daily build, but rather a human readable, self-incrementing version associated with every commit that brings file/package updates. Think of this as version 0. The following versions are going to be 3.0_minimal.1, 3.0_minimal.2, 3.0_minimal.3 and so on.

## Commit ID

The ID listed is actually the first 5 bytes (10 hex digits) of the commit hash. If you want to see the verbose mode, use the `-v` option.

```
root@photon-host [ ~ ]# rpm-ostree status -v
State: idle
AutomaticUpdates: disabled
Deployments:
* ostree://photon:photon/3.0/x86_64/minimal
                   Version: 3.0_minimal (2019-08-29T11:20:19Z)
                    Commit: a31a843985e314a9e70bcf09afe8d59f7351817d9fb743c2b6dab84f20833650
                            `- photon (2019-08-29T11:18:53Z)
                    Staged: no
                 StateRoot: photon
```

### RPM OStree Options

To see the list of options available with the rpm-ostree command, use the -h option.

```  

## OSname

The OS Name identifies the operating system installed. All bootable filetrees for the same OS will share the /var directory, in other words applications installed in one booted image into this directory will be available in all other images.  
If a new set of images are created for a different OS, they will receive a fresh copy of /var that is not shared with the previous OS images for the initial OS. In other words, if a machine is dual boot for different operating systems, they will not share each other's /var content, however they will still merge 3-way /etc.

## Refspec

The **Refspec** is a branch inside the repo, expressed in a hierarchical way. In this case, it's the default branch that will receive package updates for the Photon OS 1.0 Minimal installation profile on Intel platforms. There could be other branches in the future, for example photon/3.0/x86_64/full that will match the Full installation profile (full set of packages installed).  
Think of Refspec as the head of the minimal branch (just like in git) at the origin repo. On the replicated, local repo at the host, **minimal** is a file that contains the latest commit ID known for that branch.  

```
root@photon-host [ ~ ]# cat /ostree/repo/refs/remotes/photon/photon/3.0/x86_64/minimal 
a31a843985e314a9e70bcf09afe8d59f7351817d9fb743c2b6dab84f20833650
```
Why are there two 'photon' directory levels in the remotes path? The **photon:** prefix in the Refspec listed by `rpm-ostree status` corresponds to the first **photon** directory in the remotes path and is actually the name given to the remote that the host is connected to, which points to an http or https URL. We'll talk about remotes later, but for now think of it as a namespace qualifier.  The second **photon** is part of the Refspec path itself.

## Deployments

We've used so far `rpm-ostree`. The same information can be obtained running an `ostree` command:

```
root@photon-host [ ~ ]# ostree admin status
* photon a31a843985e314a9e70bcf09afe8d59f7351817d9fb743c2b6dab84f20833650.0
    Version: 3.0_minimal
    origin refspec: photon:photon/3.0/x86_64/minimal
```

But where is this information stored? As you may have guessed, the local repo stores the heads of the deployed trees - the most recent commitment ID, just like Git does: 

```
root@photon-host [ ~ ]# cat /ostree/repo/refs/heads/ostree/0/1/0 
a31a843985e314a9e70bcf09afe8d59f7351817d9fb743c2b6dab84f20833650
```
This also where this command that lists the references (local heads and remotes) takes its data from:

```
root@photon-host [ ~ ]# ostree refs
ostree/0/1/0
photon:photon/3.0/x86_64/minimal
```
Based on that, it could find the root of the deployment that it boots from. The actual filetree is deployed right here:

```
root@photon-host [ ~ ]#  ls -l /ostree/deploy/photon/deploy/a31a843985e314a9e70bcf09afe8d59f7351817d9fb743c2b6dab84f20833650.0

drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 sys

drwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 Jan  1  1970 usr
drwxr-xr-x  8 root root 4096 Sep  4 04:59 var
```  

So how is a deployment linked to a specific branch, originating from a remote repo? Well, there is a file next to the deployed filetree root directory with the same name and **.origin** suffix, that contains exactly this info:

```
root@photon-host [ ~ ]# cat /ostree/deploy/photon/deploy/a31a843985e314a9e70bcf09afe8d59f7351817d9fb743c2b6dab84
f20833650.0.origin
[origin]
refspec=photon:photon/3.0/x86_64/minimal
```  

Fast forwarding a bit, if there is a new deployment due to an upgrade or rebase, a new filetree will be added at the same level, and a new .origin file will tie it to the remote branch it originated from.  

The **photon** directory in the path is the actual OSname. Multiple deployments of same OS will share a writable /var folder.

```
root@photon-host [ ~ ]# ls -l /ostree/deploy/photon/var/
