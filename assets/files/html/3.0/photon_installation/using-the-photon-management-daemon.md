# Photon Management Daemon

The Photon Management Daemon (PMD) that ships with Photon OS 2.0 provides the remote management of a Photon instance via several APIs: a command line client (pmd-cli), a REST API, and a Python API. The PMD provides the ability to manage network interfaces, packages, firewalls, users, and user groups.
