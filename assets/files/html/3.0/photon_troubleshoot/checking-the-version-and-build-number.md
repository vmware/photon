# Checking the Version and Build Number

To check the version and build number of Photon OS, concatenate `/etc/photon-release`. 

Example: 

	cat /etc/photon-release
	VMware Photon Linux 1.0
	PHOTON_BUILD_NUMBER=a6f0f63

The build number in the results maps to the commit number on the VMware Photon OS GitHub [commits page](https://github.com/vmware/photon/commits/master).
