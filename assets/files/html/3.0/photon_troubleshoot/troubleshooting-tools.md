# Troubleshooting Tools

Photon OS includes tools that help troubleshoot problems. These tools are installed by default on the full version of Photon OS. On the minimal version of Photon OS, you might have to install a tool before you can use it. 

There is a man page on Photon OS for all the tools covered in this section. The man pages provide more information about each tool's commands, options, and output. To view a tool's man page, on the Photon OS command line, type `man` and then the name of the tool. Example: 

	man strace
