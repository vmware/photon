The following troubleshooting tools are included in the full version of Photon OS: 

* `grep`. Searches files for patterns. 
* `ping`. Tests network connectivity. 
* `strings`. Displays the characters in a file to identify its contents.
* `lsmod`. Lists loaded modules.
* `ipcs`. Shows data about the inter-process communication (IPC) resources to which a process has read access. This data includes shared memory segments, message queues, and semaphore arrays.
