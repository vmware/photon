# Inspect Network Settings with `netmgr`

If you are running a VMware appliance on Photon OS and the VAMI module has problems or if there are networking issues, you can use the Photon OS `netmgr` utility to inspect the networking settings. Make sure that the IP addresses for the DNS server and other infrastructure are correct. Use `tcpdump` to analyze the issues. 

The error code that you get from netmgr is a standard Unix error code. Enter it into a search engine to obtain more information on the error.
