# Tiny DNF for Package Management

On Photon OS, [Tiny Dandified Yum](https://github.com/vmware/tdnf) or Tiny DNF, is the default package manager for installing new packages. It is a C implementation of the DNF package manager. The standard syntax for `tdnf` commands is the same as that for DNF and is as follows: 

	tdnf [options] <command> [<arguments>...]
