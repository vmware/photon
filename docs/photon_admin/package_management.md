# Package Management in Photon OS with `tdnf`

Photon OS manages packages with an open source, yum-compatible package manager called `tdnf`, for [Tiny Dandified Yum](https://github.com/vmware/tdnf). Tdnf keeps the operating system as small as possible while preserving yum's robust package-management capabilities.
