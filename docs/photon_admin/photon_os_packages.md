# Photon OS Packages

The design of Photon OS simplifies life-cycle management and improves the security of packages. Photon reduces the burden and complexity of managing clusters of Linux machines by providing curated package repositories and by securing packages with GPG signatures. 
 
Photon OS is available in a variety of pre-built packages in binary formats.
