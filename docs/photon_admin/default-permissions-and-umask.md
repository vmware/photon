# Default Permissions and umask

The umask on Photon OS is set to `0027`.

When you create a new file with the `touch` command as root, the default on Photon OS is to set the permissions to `0640`--which translates to read-write for user, read for group, and no access for others. Here's an example: 

    touch newfile.md
    stat newfile.md
      File: 'newfile.md'
      Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file
    Device: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316454      Links: 1
    Access: (0640/-rw-r-----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)

When you create a directory as root, Photon OS sets the permissions to `0750`:

    mkdir newdir
    stat newdir
      File: 'newdir'
      Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory
    Device: 801h/2049d      Inode: 316455      Links: 2
    Access: (0750/drwxr-x---)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)

Because the `mkdir` command uses the umask to modify the permissions placed on newly created files or directories, you can see `umask` at work in the permissions of the new directory: Its default permissions are set at 0750 after the umask subtracts 0027 from the full set of open permissions, 0777.

Similarly, a new file begins as 0666, which you could see if you were to set umask to 0000. But because umask is set by default to 0027, a new file's permissions are set to 0640. 

So be aware of the default permissions on the directories and files that you create. Some system services and applications might require permissions other than the default. The systemd network service, for example, requires user-defined configuration files to be set to 644, not the default of 640. Thus, after you create a network configuration file with a `.network` extension, you must run the `chmod` command to set the new file's mode bits to `644`. Example: 

    chmod 644 10-static-en.network
