# Containers

A container is a process that runs on the Photon OS host with its own isolated application, file system, and networking.
 
Photon OS includes the open source version of Docker. With Docker, Photon OS becomes a Linux run-time host for containers, that is, a Linux cloud container. 
 
The full version of Photon OS includes Kubernetes so you can manage clusters of containers.
