# Signed Packages

Photon OS signs its packages and repositories with GPG signatures to bolster security. The GPG signature uses keyed-hash authentication method codes, typically the SHA1 algorithm and an MD5 checksum, to simultaneously verify the integrity and authentication of a package. A keyed-hash message authentication code combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret cryptographic key.

In Photon OS, GPG signature verification automatically takes place when you install or update a package with the default package manager, tdnf. The default setting in the tdnf configuration file for checking the GPG is set to `1`, for true:  

    cat /etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf
    [main]
    gpgcheck=1
    installonly_limit=3
    clean_requirements_on_remove=true
    repodir=/etc/yum.repos.d
    cachedir=/var/cache/tdnf

On Photon OS, you can view the key with which VMware signs packages by running the following command:  

    rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*

The command returns the GPG public key:

    gpg-pubkey-66fd4949-4803fe57

Once you have the name of the key, you can view information about the key with the `rpm -qi` command, as the following abridged output demonstrates: 

    rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-66fd4949-4803fe57
    Name        : gpg-pubkey

If you have one of the RPMs from Photon OS on another Linux system, such as Ubuntu, you can check the status of the SHA and MD5 for the package to verify that it has not been tampered with:

    rpm -K /home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm
    /home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm: sha1 md5 OK

And then you can view the SHA1 digest and the MD5 digest by running the following command: 

    rpm -Kv /home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm
    /home/steve/workspace/photon/stage/SRPMS/kubernetes-1.1.8-4.ph1.src.rpm:
    Header SHA1 digest: OK (89b55443d4c9f67a61ae0c1ec9bf4ece2d6aa32b)
            MD5 digest: OK (51eee659a8730e25fd2a52aff9a6c2c2)

The above examples show that the Kubernetes package has not been tampered with.
