# Mounting a Network File System

To mount a network file system, Photon OS requires nfs-utils. The nfs-utils package contains the daemon, userspace server, and client tools for the kernel Network File System, or NFS. The tools include mount.nfs, umount.nfs, and showmount. 

The nfs-utils package is installed by default in the full version of Photon OS but not in the minimal version. To install nfs-utils in the minimal version, run the following command as root: 

	tdnf install nfs-utils

For instructions on how to use nfs-utils to share files over a network, see [Photon OS nfs-utils](nfs-utils.md).
