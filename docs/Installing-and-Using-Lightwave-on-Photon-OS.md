# Installing and Using Lightwave on Photon OS #

Project Lightwave is an open-sourced project that provides enterprise-grade identity and access management services, and can be used to solve key security, governance, and compliance challenges for a variety of use cases within the enterprise. Through integration between Photon OS and Project Lightwave, organizations can enforce security and governance on container workloads, for example, by ensuring only authorized containers are run on authorized hosts, by authorized users. For more details about Lightwave, see the [project Lightwave page on GitHub](https://github.com/vmware/lightwave).
