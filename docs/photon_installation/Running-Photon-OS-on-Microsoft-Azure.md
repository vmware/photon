# Running Photon OS on Microsoft Azure

You can use Photon OS as a run-time environment for Linux containers on Microsoft Azure. You can set up and run the cloud-ready version of Photon OS as an instance of a virtual machine in the Azure cloud. Once Photon OS is running, you can deploy a containerized application in Docker.

**Note:** These instructions apply to Photon OS 2.0 and 3.0. There is no Photon OS 1.0 distribution image for Microsoft Azure.
