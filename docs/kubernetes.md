## Prerequisites

* You need two or more machines with the 1.0 general availability or later version of Photon OS installed.

## Instructions

This document gets you started using Kubernetes with Photon OS. The instructions present a manual configuration that gets one worker node running to help you understand  the underlying packages, services, ports, and so forth. 

The Kubernetes package provides several services: kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, kubelet, kube-proxy.  These services are managed by systemd. Their configuration resides in a central location: /etc/kubernetes.  

The following instructions break the services up between the hosts.  The first host, `photon-master`, will be the Kubernetes master.  This host will run the kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler.  In addition, the master will also run `etcd`. Although `etcd` is not needed on the master if `etcd` runs on a different host, this guide assumes that `etcd` and the Kubernetes master run on the same host.  The remaining host, `photon-node`, will be the node; it will run kubelet, proxy, and docker.

**System Information**

Hosts:

```
photon-master = 192.168.121.9
photon-node = 192.168.121.65
```

**Prepare the hosts**

The following packages should already be installed on the full version of Photon OS, but you might have to install them on the minimal version of Photon OS. If the `tdnf` command returns "Nothing to do," the package is already installed.
    
* Install Kubernetes on all hosts--both `photon-master` and `photon-node`.

```sh
tdnf install kubernetes
``` 

* Install iptables on photon-master:

```sh
tdnf install iptables
```

* Install Docker on photon-node:

```sh
tdnf install docker
```

* Add master and node to /etc/hosts on all machines (not needed if the hostnames are already in DNS). Make sure that communication works between photon-master and photon-node by using a utility such as ping.

```sh
echo "192.168.121.9	photon-master
192.168.121.65	photon-node" >> /etc/hosts
```

* Edit /etc/kubernetes/config, which will be the same on all the hosts (master and node), so that it contains the following lines:

```sh
# Comma separated list of nodes in the etcd cluster
KUBE_MASTER="--master=http://photon-master:8080"

# logging to stderr routes it to the systemd journal
KUBE_LOGTOSTDERR="--logtostderr=true"

# journal message level, 0 is debug
KUBE_LOG_LEVEL="--v=0"

# Should this cluster be allowed to run privileged docker containers
KUBE_ALLOW_PRIV="--allow_privileged=false"
```

**Configure the Kubernetes services on the master**

* Edit /etc/kubernetes/apiserver to appear as such.  The service_cluster_ip_range IP addresses must be an unused block of addresses, not used anywhere else.  They do not need to be routed or assigned to anything.

```sh
# The address on the local server to listen to.
KUBE_API_ADDRESS="--address=0.0.0.0"

# Comma separated list of nodes in the etcd cluster
KUBE_ETCD_SERVERS="--etcd_servers=http://127.0.0.1:4001"

# Address range to use for services
KUBE_SERVICE_ADDRESSES="--service-cluster-ip-range=10.254.0.0/16"

# Add your own
KUBE_API_ARGS=""
```

* Start the appropriate services on master:

```sh
for SERVICES in etcd kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler; do
	systemctl restart $SERVICES
	systemctl enable $SERVICES
	systemctl status $SERVICES
done
```

* To add the other node, create the following node.json file on the Kubernetes master node:

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "kind": "Node",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "photon-node",
        "labels":{ "name": "photon-node-label"}
    },
    "spec": {
        "externalID": "photon-node"
    }
}
```

Now create a node object internally in your Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:

```console
$ kubectl create -f ./node.json

$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                LABELS              STATUS
photon-node         name=photon-node-label     Unknown
```

Please note that in the above example, it only creates a representation for the node
_photon-node_ internally. It does not provision the actual _photon-node_. Also, it
is assumed that _photon-node_ (as specified in `name`) can be resolved and is
reachable from the Kubernetes master node. How to provision
a Kubernetes node (photon-node) is shown in a later section.

**Configure the Kubernetes services on the node**

You configure the kubelet on the node as follows. 

* Edit /etc/kubernetes/kubelet to appear like this:

```sh
###
# Kubernetes kubelet (node) config

# The address for the info server to serve on (set to 0.0.0.0 or "" for all interfaces)
KUBELET_ADDRESS="--address=0.0.0.0"

# You may leave this blank to use the actual hostname
KUBELET_HOSTNAME="--hostname_override=photon-node"

# location of the api-server
KUBELET_API_SERVER="--api_servers=http://photon-master:8080"

# Add your own
#KUBELET_ARGS=""
```

* Start the appropriate services on the node (photon-node):

```sh
for SERVICES in kube-proxy kubelet docker; do 
    systemctl restart $SERVICES
    systemctl enable $SERVICES
    systemctl status $SERVICES 
done
```

* Check to make sure that the cluster can now see the photon-node on photon-master and that its status changes to _Ready_.

```console
kubectl get nodes
NAME                LABELS              STATUS
photon-node          name=photon-node-label     Ready
```

If the node status is `NotReady`, verify that the firewall rules are permissive for Kubernetes.  

* Deletion of nodes: To delete _photon-node_ from your Kubernetes cluster, one should run the following on photon-master (please do not do it, it is just for information):

```sh
kubectl delete -f ./node.json
```

That's it. You should have a functional cluster. You can now launch a test pod. Check out [Kubernetes 101](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/) for an introduction to working with Kubernetes.
