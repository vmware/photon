 version 2.85
-        Fix problem with DNS retries in 2.83/2.84.
+        Set the default maximum DNS UDP packet sice to 1232. This
+        has been the recommended value since 2020 because it's the
+        largest value that avoid fragmentation, and fragmentation
+        is just not reliable on the modern internet, especially

+	Fix problem with DNS retries in 2.83/2.84.
         The new logic in 2.83/2.84 which merges distinct requests
 	for the same domain causes problems with clients which do
 	retries as distinct requests (differing IDs and/or source ports.)
