Subject: [PATCH] Fix rwlock stall with PREFER_WRITER_NONRECURSIVE_NP (bug
 23861)

In the read lock function (__pthread_rwlock_rdlock_full) there was a
code path which would fail to reload __readers while waiting for
PTHREAD_RWLOCK_RWAITING to change. This failure to reload __readers
into a local value meant that various conditionals used the old value
of __readers and with only two threads left it could result in an
indefinite stall of one of the readers (waiting for PTHREAD_RWLOCK_RWAITING
to go to zero, but it never would).
