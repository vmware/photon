| strcoll_l.c: In function '__strcoll_l':
| ../locale/weight.h:31:26: error: 'seq2.back_us' may be used
uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
|    int_fast32_t i = table[*(*cpp)++];
|                           ^~~~~~~~~
| strcoll_l.c:304:18: note: 'seq2.back_us' was declared here
|    coll_seq seq1, seq2;
