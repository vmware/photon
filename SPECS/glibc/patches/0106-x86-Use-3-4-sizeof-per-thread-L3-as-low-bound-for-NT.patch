Subject: [PATCH 106/175] x86: Use `3/4*sizeof(per-thread-L3)` as low bound for
 NT threshold.

On some machines we end up with incomplete cache information. This can
make the new calculation of `sizeof(total-L3)/custom-divisor` end up
lower than intended (and lower than the prior value). So reintroduce
the old bound as a lower bound to avoid potentially regressing code
where we don't have complete information to make the decision.
