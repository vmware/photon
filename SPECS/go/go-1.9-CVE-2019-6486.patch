    [release-branch.go1.11-security] crypto/elliptic: reduce subtraction term to prevent long busy loop
    
    If beta8 is unusually large, the addition loop might take a very long
    time to bring x3-beta8 back positive.
    
    This would lead to a DoS vulnerability in the implementation of the
    P-521 and P-384 elliptic curves that may let an attacker craft inputs
    to ScalarMult that consume excessive amounts of CPU.
    
    This fixes CVE-2019-6486.
