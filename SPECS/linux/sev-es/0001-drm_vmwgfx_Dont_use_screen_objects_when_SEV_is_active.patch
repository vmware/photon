Subject: drm/vmwgfx: Don't use screen objects when SEV is active

From: Zack Rusin <zackr@vmware.com>

commit 6e90293618ed476d6b11f82ce724efbb9e9a071b upstream.

When SEV is enabled gmr's and mob's are explicitly disabled because
the encrypted system memory can not be used by the hypervisor.

The driver was disabling GMR's but the presentation code, which depends
on GMR's, wasn't honoring it which lead to black screen on hosts
with SEV enabled.

Make sure screen objects presentation is not used when guest memory
regions have been disabled to fix presentation on SEV enabled hosts.
