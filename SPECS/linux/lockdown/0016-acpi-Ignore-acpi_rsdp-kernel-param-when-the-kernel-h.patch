Subject: [16/29] acpi: Ignore acpi_rsdp kernel param when the kernel has been
 locked down
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs.git/commit?id=67890a0361626ec3e035264656896c77670c414b

This option allows userspace to pass the RSDP address to the kernel, which
makes it possible for a user to modify the workings of hardware .  Reject
the option when the kernel is locked down.
