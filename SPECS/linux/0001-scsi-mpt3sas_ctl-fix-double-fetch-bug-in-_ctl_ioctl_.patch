Subject: [PATCH] scsi: mpt3sas_ctl: fix double-fetch bug in _ctl_ioctl_main()

[ This patch is not yet upstream; however, it has been accepted into
the scsi maintainer's queue. ]

In _ctl_ioctl_main(), 'ioctl_header' is fetched the first time from
userspace. 'ioctl_header.ioc_number' is then checked. The legal result is
saved to 'ioc'. Then, in condition MPT3COMMAND, the whole struct is fetched
again from the userspace. Then _ctl_do_mpt_command() is called, 'ioc' and
'karg' as inputs.

However, a malicious user can change the 'ioc_number' between the two
fetches, which will cause a potential security issues.  Moreover, a
malicious user can provide a valid 'ioc_number' to pass the check in first
fetch, and then modify it in the second fetch.

To fix this, we need to recheck the 'ioc_number' in the second fetch.
