Subject: [PATCH 04/19] bpf: Rework check_func_arg_reg_off

[ upstream commit 184c9bdb8f65d9f909b3a089a83bc0b0f1e1ea4c ]

While check_func_arg_reg_off is the place which performs generic checks
needed by various candidates of reg->type, there is some handling for
special cases, like ARG_PTR_TO_DYNPTR, OBJ_RELEASE, and
ARG_PTR_TO_RINGBUF_MEM.

This commit aims to streamline these special cases and instead leave
other things up to argument type specific code to handle. The function
will be restrictive by default, and cover all possible cases when
OBJ_RELEASE is set, without having to update the function again (and
missing to do that being a bug).

This is done primarily for two reasons: associating back reg->type to
its argument leaves room for the list getting out of sync when a new
reg->type is supported by an arg_type.

The other case is ARG_PTR_TO_RINGBUF_MEM. The problem there is something
we already handle, whenever a release argument is expected, it should
be passed as the pointer that was received from the acquire function.
Hence zero fixed and variable offset.

There is nothing special about ARG_PTR_TO_RINGBUF_MEM, where technically
its target register type PTR_TO_MEM | MEM_RINGBUF can already be passed
with non-zero offset to other helper functions, which makes sense.

Hence, lift the arg_type_is_release check for reg->off and cover all
possible register types, instead of duplicating the same kind of check
twice for current OBJ_RELEASE arg_types (alloc_mem and ptr_to_btf_id).

For the release argument, arg_type_is_dynptr is the special case, where
we go to actual object being freed through the dynptr, so the offset of
the pointer still needs to allow fixed and variable offset and
process_dynptr_func will verify them later for the release argument case
as well.

This is not specific to ARG_PTR_TO_DYNPTR though, we will need to make
this exception for any future object on the stack that needs to be
released. In this sense, PTR_TO_STACK as a candidate for object on stack
argument is a special case for release offset checks, and they need to
be done by the helper releasing the object on stack.

Since the check has been lifted above all register type checks, remove
the duplicated check that is being done for PTR_TO_BTF_ID.
