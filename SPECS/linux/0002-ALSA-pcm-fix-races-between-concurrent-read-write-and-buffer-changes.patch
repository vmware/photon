Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent read/write and buffer
 changes

commit dca947d4d26dbf925a64a6cfb2ddbc035e831a3d upstream.

In the current PCM design, the read/write syscalls (as well as the
equivalent ioctls) are allowed before the PCM stream is running, that
is, at PCM PREPARED state.  Meanwhile, we also allow to re-issue
hw_params and hw_free ioctl calls at the PREPARED state that may
change or free the buffers, too.  The problem is that there is no
protection against those mix-ups.

This patch applies the previously introduced runtime->buffer_mutex to
the read/write operations so that the concurrent hw_params or hw_free
call can no longer interfere during the operation.  The mutex is
unlocked before scheduling, so we don't take it too long.
