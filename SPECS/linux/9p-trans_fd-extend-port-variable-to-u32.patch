Subject: [PATCH] 9p: trans_fd: extend port variable to u32

This patch is an addition to vsock transport for 9p patch.
vsock layer uses 32 bits for the port number but trans_fd
options parser limits it to 16 bits. It is safe to extend
it since it is internal structure and does not break
existing code.
