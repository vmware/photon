Subject: [PATCH 3/4] kbuild, Makefile: Introduce macros to distinguish Photon
 kernel flavors/versions

Out-of-tree drivers such as Intel i40e, iavf and ice, which support
multiple kernel versions and distros, use kernel compability checks
based on the kernel version or distro version to identify if certain
features required by those drivers are available in the given version
of the distro or upstream kernel that the driver is being built for.

We have backported certain features from upstream (ex: 5.0+) to older
kernel versions (ex: 4.19) in Photon OS (such as the support for
PTP_SYS_OFFSET_EXTENDED_IOCTL and PTP_CLOCK_INFO_GETTIMEX64), as they
help enhance the functionality of these drivers. Therefore, kernel
compat checks performed by these out-of-tree drivers at build-time
purely based on the Linux kernel version alone are not sufficient to
accurately identify the supported features in a given Photon distro
kernel version or flavor. (For example, kcompat.h in the ice driver
assumes that kernel versions less than 5.0 do not support these
features, and adds empty stubs for these functions).

To mitigate this problem, introduce Photon kernel macros to help
identify and parse Photon kernel flavors and versions to simplify
building out-of-tree drivers for Photon OS.

For example, the exposed macros can be used by the driver to identify
Photon kernel flavors and versions that have the
PTP_SYS_OFFSET_EXTENDED_IOCTL and PTP_CLOCK_INFO_GETTIMEX64 support
included, so that the empty stubs from kcompat.h can be skipped when
building i40e/iavf/ice drivers for such kernels. The design for
exposing these Photon kernel macros is generic and can be used to
build other out-of-tree drivers too.

A typical Photon kernel version output from uname -r looks like this:
	5.10.168-14.ph4-xyz
where,
	5.10.168 = Linux kernel version <major>.<patchlevel>.<sublevel>
	14 = Photon Kernel Release Number
	ph4 = Distro Version (ex: The number '4' represents Photon OS 4.0)
	-xyz = Photon Kernel Flavor (an empty suffix indicates the
	       generic flavor)

Thus, the combination of LINUX_VERSION_MAJOR/PATCHLEVEL/SUBLEVEL,
PHOTON_KERNEL_RELEASE, and PHOTON_KERNEL_FLAVOR_XYZ gives sufficient
info to parse Photon kernel versions.

In addition, the PHOTON_KERNEL macro is defined irrespective of the
kernel flavor, which helps identify any Photon kernel.

A sample snippet of include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h after this
change is shown below:

\#define LINUX_VERSION_MAJOR 5
\#define LINUX_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL 10
\#define LINUX_VERSION_SUBLEVEL 168

\#define PHOTON_KERNEL
\#define PHOTON_KERNEL_RELEASE 14
\#define PHOTON_KERNEL_FLAVOR_RT

[ Notes: Add include/config/kernel.release as a dependency for
generating the include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h file, to make
sure that the $KERNELRELEASE variable is not empty when attempting to
use it in generating version.h ]
