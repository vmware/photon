Subject: [PATCH 05/13] timekeeping: Use seqcount_latch_t
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Latch sequence counters are a multiversion concurrency control mechanism
where the seqcount_t counter even/odd value is used to switch between
two data storage copies. This allows the seqcount_t read path to safely
interrupt its write side critical section (e.g. from NMIs).

Initially, latch sequence counters were implemented as a single write
function, raw_write_seqcount_latch(), above plain seqcount_t. The read
path was expected to use plain seqcount_t raw_read_seqcount().

A specialized read function was later added, raw_read_seqcount_latch(),
and became the standardized way for latch read paths. Having unique read
and write APIs meant that latch sequence counters are basically a data
type of their own -- just inappropriately overloading plain seqcount_t.
The seqcount_latch_t data type was thus introduced at seqlock.h.

Use that new data type instead of seqcount_raw_spinlock_t. This ensures
that only latch-safe APIs are to be used with the sequence counter.

Note that the use of seqcount_raw_spinlock_t was not very useful in the
first place. Only the "raw_" subset of seqcount_t APIs were used at
timekeeping.c. This subset was created for contexts where lockdep cannot
be used. seqcount_LOCKTYPE_t's raison d'être -- verifying that the
seqcount_t writer serialization lock is held -- cannot thus be done.
