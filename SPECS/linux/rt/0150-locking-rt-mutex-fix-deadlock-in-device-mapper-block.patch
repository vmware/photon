Subject: [PATCH 150/335] locking/rt-mutex: fix deadlock in device mapper /
 block-IO

When some block device driver creates a bio and submits it to another
block device driver, the bio is added to current->bio_list (in order to
avoid unbounded recursion).

However, this queuing of bios can cause deadlocks, in order to avoid them,
device mapper registers a function flush_current_bio_list. This function
is called when device mapper driver blocks. It redirects bios queued on
current->bio_list to helper workqueues, so that these bios can proceed
even if the driver is blocked.

The problem with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_FULL is that when the device mapper
driver blocks, it won't call flush_current_bio_list (because
tsk_is_pi_blocked returns true in sched_submit_work), so deadlocks in
block device stack can happen.

Note that we can't call blk_schedule_flush_plug if tsk_is_pi_blocked
returns true - that would cause
BUG_ON(rt_mutex_real_waiter(task->pi_blocked_on)) in
task_blocks_on_rt_mutex when flush_current_bio_list attempts to take a
spinlock.

So the proper fix is to call blk_schedule_flush_plug in rt_mutex_fastlock,
when fast acquire failed and when the task is about to block.

[bigeasy: The deadlock is not device-mapper specific, it can also occur
          in plain EXT4]
