Subject: [PATCH 007/296] sched/hotplug: Consolidate task migration on CPU
 unplug

With the new mechanism which kicks tasks off the outgoing CPU at the end of
schedule() the situation on an outgoing CPU right before the stopper thread
brings it down completely is:

 - All user tasks and all unbound kernel threads have either been migrated
   away or are not running and the next wakeup will move them to a online CPU.

 - All per CPU kernel threads, except cpu hotplug thread and the stopper
   thread have either been unbound or parked by the responsible CPU hotplug
   callback.

That means that at the last step before the stopper thread is invoked the
cpu hotplug thread is the last legitimate running task on the outgoing
CPU.

Add a final wait step right before the stopper thread is kicked which
ensures that any still running tasks on the way to park or on the way to
kick themself of the CPU are either sleeping or gone.

This allows to remove the migrate_tasks() crutch in sched_cpu_dying(). If
sched_cpu_dying() detects that there is still another running task aside of
the stopper thread then it will explode with the appropriate fireworks.
