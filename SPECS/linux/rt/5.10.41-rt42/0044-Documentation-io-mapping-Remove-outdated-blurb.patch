Subject: [PATCH 044/296] Documentation/io-mapping: Remove outdated blurb

The implementation details in the documentation are outdated and not really
helpful. Remove them.

-Current Implementation
-======================
-
-The initial implementation of these functions uses existing mapping
-mechanisms and so provides only an abstraction layer and no new
-functionality.
-
-On 64-bit processors, io_mapping_create_wc calls ioremap_wc for the whole
-range, creating a permanent kernel-visible mapping to the resource. The
-map_atomic and map functions add the requested offset to the base of the
-virtual address returned by ioremap_wc.
-
-On 32-bit processors with HIGHMEM defined, io_mapping_map_atomic_wc uses
-kmap_atomic_pfn to map the specified page in an atomic fashion;
-kmap_atomic_pfn isn't really supposed to be used with device pages, but it
-provides an efficient mapping for this usage.
-
-On 32-bit processors without HIGHMEM defined, io_mapping_map_atomic_wc and
-io_mapping_map_wc both use ioremap_wc, a terribly inefficient function which
-performs an IPI to inform all processors about the new mapping. This results
-in a significant performance penalty.
