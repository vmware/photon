Subject: [PATCH 082/321] printk: limit second loop of syslog_print_all

The second loop of syslog_print_all() subtracts lengths that were
added in the first loop. With commit b031a684bfd0 ("printk: remove
logbuf_lock writer-protection of ringbuffer") it is possible that
records are (over)written during syslog_print_all(). This allows the
possibility of the second loop subtracting lengths that were never
added in the first loop.

This situation can result in syslog_print_all() filling the buffer
starting from a later record, even though there may have been room
to fit the earlier record(s) as well.

Fixes: b031a684bfd0 ("printk: remove logbuf_lock writer-protection of ringbuffer")
