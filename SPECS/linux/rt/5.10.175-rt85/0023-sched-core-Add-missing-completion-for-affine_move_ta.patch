Subject: [PATCH 023/321] sched/core: Add missing completion for
 affine_move_task() waiters

Qian reported that some fuzzer issuing sched_setaffinity() ends up stuck on
a wait_for_completion(). The problematic pattern seems to be:

  affine_move_task()
      // task_running() case
      stop_one_cpu();
      wait_for_completion(&pending->done);

Combined with, on the stopper side:

  migration_cpu_stop()
    // Task moved between unlocks and scheduling the stopper
    task_rq(p) != rq &&
    // task_running() case
    dest_cpu >= 0

    => no complete_all()

This can happen with both PREEMPT and !PREEMPT, although !PREEMPT should
be more likely to see this given the targeted task has a much bigger window
to block and be woken up elsewhere before the stopper runs.

Make migration_cpu_stop() always look at pending affinity requests; signal
their completion if the stopper hits a rq mismatch but the task is
still within its allowed mask. When Migrate-Disable isn't involved, this
matches the previous set_cpus_allowed_ptr() vs migration_cpu_stop()
behaviour.

Fixes: 6d337eab041d ("sched: Fix migrate_disable() vs set_cpus_allowed_ptr()")
