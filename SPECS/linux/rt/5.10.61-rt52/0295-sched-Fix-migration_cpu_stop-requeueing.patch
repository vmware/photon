Subject: [PATCH 295/304] sched: Fix migration_cpu_stop() requeueing

commit 8a6edb5257e2a84720fe78cb179eca58ba76126f upstream.

When affine_move_task(p) is called on a running task @p, which is not
otherwise already changing affinity, we'll first set
p->migration_pending and then do:

	 stop_one_cpu(cpu_of_rq(rq), migration_cpu_stop, &arg);

This then gets us to migration_cpu_stop() running on the CPU that was
previously running our victim task @p.

If we find that our task is no longer on that runqueue (this can
happen because of a concurrent migration due to load-balance etc.),
then we'll end up at the:

	} else if (dest_cpu < 1 || pending) {

branch. Which we'll take because we set pending earlier. Here we first
check if the task @p has already satisfied the affinity constraints,
if so we bail early [A]. Otherwise we'll reissue migration_cpu_stop()
onto the CPU that is now hosting our task @p:

	stop_one_cpu_nowait(cpu_of(rq), migration_cpu_stop,
			    &pending->arg, &pending->stop_work);

Except, we've never initialized pending->arg, which will be all 0s.

This then results in running migration_cpu_stop() on the next CPU with
arg->p == NULL, which gives the by now obvious result of fireworks.

The cure is to change affine_move_task() to always use pending->arg,
furthermore we can use the exact same pattern as the
SCA_MIGRATE_ENABLE case, since we'll block on the pending->done
completion anyway, no point in adding yet another completion in
stop_one_cpu().

This then gives a clear distinction between the two
migration_cpu_stop() use cases:

  - sched_exec() / migrate_task_to() : arg->pending == NULL
  - affine_move_task() : arg->pending != NULL;

And we can have it ignore p->migration_pending when !arg->pending. Any
stop work from sched_exec() / migrate_task_to() is in addition to stop
works from affine_move_task(), which will be sufficient to issue the
completion.
