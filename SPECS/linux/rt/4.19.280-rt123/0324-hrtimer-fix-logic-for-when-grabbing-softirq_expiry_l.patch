Subject: [PATCH 324/353] hrtimer: fix logic for when grabbing
 softirq_expiry_lock can be elided

Commit

  hrtimer: Add a missing bracket and hide `migration_base' on !SMP

which is 47b6de0b7f22 in 5.2-rt and 40aae5708e7a in 4.19-rt,
inadvertently changed the logic from base != &migration_base to base
== &migration_base.

On !CONFIG_SMP, the effect was to effectively always elide this
lock/unlock pair (since is_migration_base() is unconditionally false),
which for me consistently causes lockups during reboot, and reportedly
also often causes a hang during boot.

Adding this logical negation (or, what is effectively the same thing
on !CONFIG_SMP, reverting the above commit as well as "hrtimer:
Prevent using hrtimer_grab_expiry_lock() on migration_base") fixes
that lockup.

Fixes: 40aae5708e7a (hrtimer: Add a missing bracket and hide `migration_base' on !SMP) # 4.19-rt
Fixes: 47b6de0b7f22 (hrtimer: Add a missing bracket and hide `migration_base' on !SMP) # 5.2-rt
