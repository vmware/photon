Subject: [PATCH 131/353] futex: Ensure lock/unlock symetry versus pi_lock and
 hash bucket lock

In exit_pi_state_list() we have the following locking construct:

   spin_lock(&hb->lock);
   raw_spin_lock_irq(&curr->pi_lock);

   ...
   spin_unlock(&hb->lock);

In !RT this works, but on RT the migrate_enable() function which is
called from spin_unlock() sees atomic context due to the held pi_lock
and just decrements the migrate_disable_atomic counter of the
task. Now the next call to migrate_disable() sees the counter being
negative and issues a warning. That check should be in
migrate_enable() already.

Fix this by dropping pi_lock before unlocking hb->lock and reaquire
pi_lock after that again. This is safe as the loop code reevaluates
head again under the pi_lock.
