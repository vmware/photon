Subject: [PATCH 300/322] sched: Switch wait_task_inactive to
 HRTIMER_MODE_REL_HARD

With PREEMPT_RT enabled all hrtimers callbacks will be invoked in
softirq mode unless they are explicitly marked as HRTIMER_MODE_HARD.
During boot kthread_bind() is used for the creation of per-CPU threads
and then hangs in wait_task_inactive() if the ksoftirqd is not
yet up and running.
The hang disappeared since commit
   26c7295be0c5e ("kthread: Do not preempt current task if it is going to call schedule()")

but enabling function trace on boot reliably leads to the freeze on boot
behaviour again.
The timer in wait_task_inactive() can not be directly used by an user
interface to abuse it and create a mass wake of several tasks at the
same time which would to long sections with disabled interrupts.
Therefore it is safe to make the timer HRTIMER_MODE_REL_HARD.

Switch the timer to HRTIMER_MODE_REL_HARD.
