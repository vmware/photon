Subject: [PATCH] mm: fix exec activate_mm vs TLB shootdown and lazy tlb
 switching race

Reading and modifying current->mm and current->active_mm and switching
mm should be done with irqs off, to prevent races seeing an intermediate
state.

This is similar to commit 38cf307c1f20 ("mm: fix kthread_use_mm() vs TLB
invalidate"). At exec-time when the new mm is activated, the old one
should usually be single-threaded and no longer used, unless something
else is holding an mm_users reference (which may be possible).

Absent other mm_users, there is also a race with preemption and lazy tlb
switching. Consider the kernel_execve case where the current thread is
using a lazy tlb active mm:

  call_usermodehelper()
    kernel_execve()
      old_mm = current->mm;
      active_mm = current->active_mm;
      *** preempt *** -------------------->  schedule()
                                               prev->active_mm = NULL;
                                               mmdrop(prev active_mm);
                                             ...
                      <--------------------  schedule()
      current->mm = mm;
      current->active_mm = mm;
      if (!old_mm)
          mmdrop(active_mm);

If we switch back to the kernel thread from a different mm, there is a
double free of the old active_mm, and a missing free of the new one.

Closing this race only requires interrupts to be disabled while ->mm
and ->active_mm are being switched, but the TLB problem requires also
holding interrupts off over activate_mm. Unfortunately not all archs
can do that yet, e.g., arm defers the switch if irqs are disabled and
expects finish_arch_post_lock_switch() to be called to complete the
flush; um takes a blocking lock in activate_mm().

So as a first step, disable interrupts across the mm/active_mm updates
to close the lazy tlb preempt race, and provide an arch option to
extend that to activate_mm which allows architectures doing IPI based
TLB shootdowns to close the second race.

This is a bit ugly, but in the interest of fixing the bug and backporting
before all architectures are converted this is a compromise.
