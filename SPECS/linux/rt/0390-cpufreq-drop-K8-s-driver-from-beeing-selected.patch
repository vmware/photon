Subject: [PATCH 390/414] cpufreq: drop K8's driver from beeing selected

Ralf posted a picture of a backtrace from

| powernowk8_target_fn() -> transition_frequency_fidvid() and then at the
| end:
| 932         policy = cpufreq_cpu_get(smp_processor_id());
| 933         cpufreq_cpu_put(policy);

crashing the system on -RT. I assumed that policy was a NULL pointer but
was rulled out. Since Ralf can't do any more investigations on this and
I have no machine with this, I simply switch it off.
