Subject: [PATCH 026/414] hrtimer: Make room in struct hrtimer_cpu_base

The upcoming softirq based hrtimers support requires an additional field in
the hrtimer_cpu_base struct, which would grow the struct size beyond a
cache line.

The struct members nr_retries and nr_hangs of hrtimer_cpu_base are solely
used for diagnostic output and have no requirement to be unsigned int.

Make them unsigned short to create room for the new struct member. No
functional change.
