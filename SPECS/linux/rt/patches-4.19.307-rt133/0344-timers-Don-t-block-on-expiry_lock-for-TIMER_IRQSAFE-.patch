Subject: [PATCH 344/353] timers: Don't block on ->expiry_lock for
 TIMER_IRQSAFE timers

Upstream commit c725dafc95f1b37027840aaeaa8b7e4e9cd20516

PREEMPT_RT does not spin and wait until a running timer completes its
callback but instead it blocks on a sleeping lock to prevent a livelock in
the case that the task waiting for the callback completion preempted the
callback.

This cannot be done for timers flagged with TIMER_IRQSAFE. These timers can
be canceled from an interrupt disabled context even on RT kernels.

The expiry callback of such timers is invoked with interrupts disabled so
there is no need to use the expiry lock mechanism because obviously the
callback cannot be preempted even on RT kernels.

Do not use the timer_base::expiry_lock mechanism when waiting for a running
callback to complete if the timer is flagged with TIMER_IRQSAFE.

Also add a lockdep assertion for RT kernels to validate that the expiry
lock mechanism is always invoked in preemptible context.

[bigeasy: The logic in v4.19 is slightly different but the outcome is the
   same as we must not sleep while waiting for the irqsafe timer to
   complete. The IRQSAFE timer can not be preempted.
   The "lockdep annotation" is not available and has been replaced with
   might_sleep()]
