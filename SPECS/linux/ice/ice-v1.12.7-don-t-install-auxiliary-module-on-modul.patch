Subject: [PATCH] ice-1.11.14: don't install auxiliary module on
 modules_install_no_aux

modules_install_no_aux inconveniently installs the auxiliary module
despite what the name would suggest.

This happens because the auxiliary module is saved to the same location
as the normal driver module, so when the driver Makefile calls
modules_install with the Linux kernel Makefile, both modules are installed.

The Linux kernel modules_install reads the .mod files generated
during the module build process to determine the modules to install.
These .mod files are simply text files with the path to the .ko file.
(and also a .o file).

Avoid installing the auxiliary module during modules_install_no_aux
by removing the .mod file that tells modules_install that it exists.
