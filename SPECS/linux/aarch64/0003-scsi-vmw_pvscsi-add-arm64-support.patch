Subject: [PATCH 3/6] scsi: vmw_pvscsi: add arm64 support

Upgrade barriers to virtual machine specific barriers, that will map to
actual memory barrier instructions for the arm weaker memory model
ordering.

Disable driver if 16KB or 64KB pages are selected as the VMware hypervisor
assumes 4KB page size at the moment.
