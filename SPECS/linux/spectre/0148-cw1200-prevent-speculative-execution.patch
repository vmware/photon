Subject: [PATCH 148/194] cw1200: prevent speculative execution

Since the queue value in function cw1200_conf_tx()
seems to be controllable by userspace and later on
conditionally (upon bound check) used in
WSM_TX_QUEUE_SET, insert an observable speculation
barrier before its usage. This should prevent
observable speculation on that branch and avoid
kernel memory leak.
