Subject: [PATCH 146/194] p54: prevent speculative execution

Since the queue value in function p54_conf_tx()
seems to be controllable by userspace and later on
conditionally (upon bound check) used to resolve
priv->qos_params, insert an observable speculation
barrier before its usage. This should prevent
observable speculation on that branch and avoid
kernel memory leak.
