Subject: [PATCH] cifs: Fix UAF in cifs_demultiplex_thread()

[ Upstream commit d527f51331cace562393a8038d870b3e9916686f ]

There is a UAF when xfstests on cifs:

1. After send request to server, wait the response until
    mid->mid_state != SUBMITTED;
2. Receive response from server, and set it to mid;
3. Set the mid state to RECEIVED;
4. Kill the process, the mid state already RECEIVED, get 0;
5. Handle and release the negotiate response;
6. UAF.

It can be easily reproduce with add some delay in [3] - [6].

Only sync call has the problem since async call's callback is
executed in cifsd process.

Add an extra state to mark the mid state to READY before wakeup the
waitter, then it can get the resp safely.
