Subject: blk-wbt: Avoid lock contention and thundering herd issue in wbt_wait

This patch modifies commit e34cbd307477a (blk-wbt: add general
throttling mechanism)
In the original patch, wbt_done is waking up all the exclusive
processes in the wait queue, which can cause a thundering herd
if there is a large number of writer threads in the queue. The
original intention of the code seems to be to wake up one thread
only however, it uses wake_up_all() in __wbt_done(), and then
uses the following check in __wbt_wait to have only one thread
actually get out of the wait loop:

if (waitqueue_active(&rqw->wait) &&
            rqw->wait.head.next != &wait->entry)
                return false;

The problem with this is that the wait entry in wbt_wait is
define with DEFINE_WAIT, which uses the autoremove wakeup function.
That means that the above check is invalid - the wait entry will
have been removed from the queue already by the time we hit the
check in the loop.

Secondly, auto-removing the wait entries also means that the wait
queue essentially gets reordered "randomly" (e.g. threads re-add
themselves in the order they got to run after being woken up).
Additionally, new requests entering wbt_wait might overtake requests
that were queued earlier, because the wait queue will be
(temporarily) empty after the wake_up_all, so the waitqueue_active
check will not stop them. This can cause certain threads to starve
under high load.

The fix is to leave the woken up requests in the queue and remove
them in finish_wait() once the current thread breaks out of the
wait loop in __wbt_wait. This will ensure new requests always
end up at the back of the queue, and they won't overtake requests
that are already in the wait queue. With that change, the loop
in wbt_wait is also in line with many other wait loops in the kernel.
Waking up just one thread drastically reduces lock contention, as
does moving the wait queue add/remove out of the loop.
