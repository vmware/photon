Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Added PAX_RANDKSTACK

   Reworked to randomize kernel stack at entry of each syscall instead of exit
   
   Documentation of the original patch

   1. Design

   The goal of RANDKSTACK is to introduce randomness into the kernel stack
   addresses of a task.

   Linux assigns two pages of kernel stack to every task. This stack is used
   whenever the task enters the kernel (system call, device interrupt, CPU
   exception, etc). Note that once the task is executing in kernel land,
   further kernel (re)entry events (device interrupts or CPU exceptions can
   occur at almost any time) will not cause a stack switch.

   By the time the task returns to userland, the kernel land stack pointer
   will be at the point of the initial entry to the kernel (this also means
   that signals are not delivered to the task until it is ready to return to
   userland, that is signals are asynchronous notifications from the userland
   point of view, not from the kernel's).

   This behaviour means that a userland originating attack against a kernel
   bug would find itself always at the same place on the task's kernel stack
   therefore we will introduce randomization into the initial value of the
   task's kernel stack pointer. There is another interesting consequence in
   that we can not only introduce but also change the randomization at each
   userland/kernel transition (compare this to RANDUSTACK where the userland
   stack pointer is randomized only once at the very beginning of the task's
   life therefore it is vulnerable to information leaking attacks). In the
   current implementation we opted for changing the randomization at every
   system call since that is the most likely method of kernel entry during
   an attack. Note that while per system call randomization prevents making
   use of leaked information about the randomization in a given task, it does
   not help with attacks where more than one task is involved (where one task
   may be able to learn the randomization of another and then communicate it
   to the other without having to enter the kernel).

   2. Implementation

   RANDKSTACK randomizes every task's kernel stack pointer before returning
   from a system call to userland. The i386 specific system call entry point
   is in arch/i386/kernel/entry.S and this is where PaX adds a call to the
   kernel stack pointer randomization function pax_randomize_kstack() found
   in arch/i386/kernel/process.c. The code in entry.S needs to duplicate some
   code found at the ret_from_sys_call label because this code can be reached
   from different paths (e.g., exception handlers) where we do not want to
   apply randomization. Note also that if the task is being debugged (via
   the ptrace() interface) then new randomization is not applied.

   pax_randomize_kstack() gathers entropy from the rdtsc instruction (read
   time stamp counter) and applies it to bits 2-6 of the kernel stack pointer.
   This means that 5 bits are randomized providing a maximum shift of 128
   bytes - this was deemed safe enough to not cause kernel stack overflows
   yet give enough randomness to deter guessing/brute forcing attempts.

   The use of rdtsc is justified by the facts that we need a quick entropy
   source and that by the time a remote attacker would get to execute his
   code to exploit a kernel bug, enough system calls would have been issued
   by the attacked process to accumulate more than 5 bits of 'real' entropy
   in the randomized bits (this is why xor is used to apply the rdtsc output).
   Note that most likely due to its microarchitecture, the Intel P4 CPU seems
   to always return the same value in the least significant bit of the time
   stamp counter therefore we ignore it in kernels compiled for the P4.

   The kernel stack pointer has to be modified at two places: tss->esp0 which
   is the ring-0 stack pointer in the Task State Segment of the current CPU
   (and is used to load esp on a ring transition, such as a system call), and
   second, current->thread.esp0 which is used to reload tss->esp0 on a context
   switch. There is one last subtlety: since the randomization is applied via
   xor and the initial kernel stack pointer of a new task points just above
   its assigned stack (and hence is a page aligned address), we would produce
   esp values pointing above the assigned stack, therefore in copy_thread() we
   initialize thread.esp0 to 4 bytes less than usual so that the randomization
   will shift it within the assigned stack and not above. Since this solution
   'wastes' a mere 4 bytes on the kernel stack, we saw no need to apply it
   selectively to specific tasks only.
