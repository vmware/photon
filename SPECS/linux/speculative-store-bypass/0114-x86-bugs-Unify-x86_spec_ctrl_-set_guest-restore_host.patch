Subject: [PATCH 114/120] x86/bugs: Unify
 x86_spec_ctrl_{set_guest,restore_host}

commit cc69b34989210f067b2c51d5539b5f96ebcc3a01 upstream

Function bodies are very similar and are going to grow more almost
identical code. Add a bool arg to determine whether SPEC_CTRL is being set
for the guest or restored to the host.

No functional changes.
