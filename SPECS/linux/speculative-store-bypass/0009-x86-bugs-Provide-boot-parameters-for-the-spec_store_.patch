Subject: [PATCH 09/31] x86/bugs: Provide boot parameters for the
 spec_store_bypass_disable mitigation

Contemporary high performance processors use a common industry-wide
optimization known as "Speculative Store Bypass" in which loads from
addresses to which a recent store has occurred may (speculatively) see an
older value. Intel refers to this feature as "Memory Disambiguation" which
is part of their "Smart Memory Access" capability.

Memory Disambiguation can expose a cache side-channel attack against such
speculatively read values. An attacker can create exploit code that allows
them to read memory outside of a sandbox environment (for example,
malicious JavaScript in a web page), or to perform more complex attacks
against code running within the same privilege level, e.g. via the stack.

As a first step to mitigate against such attacks, provide two boot command
line control knobs:

 nospec_store_bypass_disable
 spec_store_bypass_disable=[off,auto,on]

By default affected x86 processors will power on with Speculative
Store Bypass enabled. Hence the provided kernel parameters are written
from the point of view of whether to enable a mitigation or not.
The parameters are as follows:

 - auto - Kernel detects whether your CPU model contains an implementation
	  of Speculative Store Bypass and picks the most appropriate
	  mitigation.

 - on   - disable Speculative Store Bypass
 - off  - enable Speculative Store Bypass

[ tglx: Reordered the checks so that the whole evaluation is not done
  	when the CPU does not support RDS ]

+			Certain CPUs are vulnerable to an exploit against a
+			a common industry wide performance optimization known
+			as "Speculative Store Bypass" in which recent stores

+			end of a particular speculation execution window.
+
+			In vulnerable processors, the speculatively forwarded
+			store can be used in a cache side channel attack, for
+			example to read memory to which the attacker does not
+			directly have access (e.g. inside sandboxed code).
