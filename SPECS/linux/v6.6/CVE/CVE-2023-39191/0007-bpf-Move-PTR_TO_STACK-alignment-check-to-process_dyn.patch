Subject: [PATCH 07/19] bpf: Move PTR_TO_STACK alignment check to process_dynptr_func

[ upstream commit f6ee298fa140f6b5bae3acf6d6108741278bcced ]

After previous commit, we are minimizing helper specific assumptions
from check_func_arg_reg_off, making it generic, and offloading checks
for a specific argument type to their respective functions called after
check_func_arg_reg_off has been called.

This allows relying on a consistent set of guarantees after that call
and then relying on them in code that deals with registers for each
argument type later. This is in line with how process_spin_lock,
process_timer_func, process_kptr_func check reg->var_off to be constant.
The same reasoning is used here to move the alignment check into
process_dynptr_func. Note that it also needs to check for constant
var_off, and accumulate the constant var_off when computing the spi in
get_spi, but that fix will come in later changes.
