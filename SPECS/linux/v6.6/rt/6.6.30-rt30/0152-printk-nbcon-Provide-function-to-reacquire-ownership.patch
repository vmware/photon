Subject: [PATCH 152/196] printk: nbcon: Provide function to reacquire
 ownership

Contexts may become nbcon owners for various reasons, not just
for printing. Indeed, the port->lock wrapper takes ownership
for anything relating to the hardware.

Since ownership can be lost at any time due to handover or
takeover, a context _should_ be prepared to back out
immediately and carefully. However, there are many scenarios
where the context _must_ reacquire ownership in order to
finalize or revert hardware changes.

One such example is when interrupts are disabled by a context.
No other context will automagically re-enable the interrupts.
For this case, the disabling context _must_ reacquire nbcon
ownership so that it can re-enable the interrupts.

Provide nbcon_reacquire() for exactly this purpose.

Note that for printing contexts, after a successful reacquire
the context will have no output buffer because that has been
lost. nbcon_reacquire() cannot be used to resume printing.
