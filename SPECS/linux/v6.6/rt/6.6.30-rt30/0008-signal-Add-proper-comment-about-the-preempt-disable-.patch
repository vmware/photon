Subject: [PATCH 008/196] signal: Add proper comment about the preempt-disable
 in ptrace_stop().

Commit 53da1d9456fe7 ("fix ptrace slowness") added a preempt-disable section
between read_unlock() and the following schedule() invocation without
explaining why it is needed.

Replace the comment with an explanation why this is needed. Clarify that
it is needed for correctness but for performance reasons.

 	 *
-	 * XXX: implement read_unlock_no_resched().
+	 * This preemption point is not bad from correctness point of view but
+	 * extends the runtime by one HZ tick time due to the ptracer's sleep.
+	 * The preempt-disable section ensures that there will be no preemption
+	 * between unlock and schedule() and so improving the performance since
