Subject: [PATCH 105/196] printk: nbcon: Add ownership state functions

Provide functions that are related to the safe handover mechanism
and allow console drivers to dynamically specify unsafe regions:

 - nbcon_context_can_proceed()

   Invoked by a console owner to check whether a handover request
   is pending or whether the console has been taken over by another
   context. If a handover request is pending, this function will
   also perform the handover, thus cancelling its own ownership.

 - nbcon_context_enter_unsafe()/nbcon_context_exit_unsafe()

   Invoked by a console owner to denote that the driver is about
   to enter or leave a critical region where a take over is unsafe.
   The exit variant is the point where the current owner releases
   the lock for a higher priority context which asked for the
   friendly handover.

   The unsafe state is stored in the console state and allows a
   new context to make informed decisions whether to attempt a
   takeover of such a console. The unsafe state is also available
   to the driver so that it can make informed decisions about the
   required actions and possibly take a special emergency path.
