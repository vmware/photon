Subject: [PATCH 124/196] printk: nbcon: Ensure ownership release on failed
 emit

Until now it was assumed that ownership has been lost when the
write_atomic() callback fails. nbcon_emit_next_record() only
returns false when ownership has been lost.

Ensure ownership has been lost before reporting failure by
explicitly attempting a release. If the current context is not
the owner, the release has no effect.
