Subject: [PATCH] sched/rt: Disable RT_RUNTIME_SHARE by default

The RT_RUNTIME_SHARE sched feature enables the sharing of rt_runtime
between CPUs, allowing a CPU to run a real-time task up to 100% of the
time while leaving more space for non-real-time tasks to run on the CPU
that lend rt_runtime.

The problem is that a CPU can easily borrow enough rt_runtime to allow
a spinning rt-task to run forever, starving per-cpu tasks like kworkers,
which are non-real-time by design.

This patch disables RT_RUNTIME_SHARE by default, avoiding this problem.
The feature will still be present for users that want to enable it,
though.
