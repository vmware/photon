%description
ipvsadm is used to setup, maintain, and inspect the virtual server
table in the Linux kernel. The Linux Virtual Server can be used to
build scalable network services based on a cluster of two or more
nodes. The active node of the cluster redirects service requests to a
collection of server hosts that will actually perform the
services.

Supported Features include:
two protocols (TCP and UDP), three packet-forwarding methods
(NAT, tunneling, and direct routing), and eight load balancing algorithms
(round robin  weighted round robin, least-connection, weighted least-connection,
locality-based least-connection, locality-based least-connection with replication,
destination-hashing, and source-hashing).
