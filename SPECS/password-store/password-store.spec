%description
Password management should be simple and follow Unix philosophy. With pass,
each password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose filename is the title
of the website or resource that requires the password. These encrypted files
may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies, copied from computer to
computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard command line file
management utilities.
