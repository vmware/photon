Subject: [PATCH] pahole: Support '--lang/--lang_exclude=asm'
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

It is disjoint from the other languages and then the first simple
implementation of language inclusion/exclusion didn't support it, add
an special case to test against 0x8001 (DW_LANG_Mips_Assembler) to cover
that.

This is needed as recently compilers started to add DWARF constructs to
represent asm CUs that broke pahole as it didn't support
DW_TAG_unspecified_type as a "type", so add it in case in the future we
want to exclude such CUs.

The DW_TAG_unspecified_type tag is going to be supported in the next
csets tho.

We also may want this to exclude new tags that aren't supported in BTF,
etc.
