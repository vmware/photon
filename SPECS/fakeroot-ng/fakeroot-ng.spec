%description
Fakeroot-ng is a clean re-implementation of fakeroot. The core idea 
is to run a program, but wrap all system calls that program performs 
so that it thinks it is running as root, while it is, in practice, 
running as an unprivileged user. When the program is trying to perform 
a privileged operation (such as modifying a file's owner or creating 
a block device), this operation is emulated, so that an unprivileged 
operation is actually carried out, but the result of the privileged 
operation is reported to the program whenever it attempts to query 
the result.
