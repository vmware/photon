Subject: [PATCH 13/16] gdbusconnection: Don't deliver signals if the sender
 doesn't match

Otherwise a malicious connection on a shared bus, especially the system
bus, could trick GDBus clients into processing signals sent by the
malicious connection as though they had come from the real owner of a
well-known service name.
