Subject: [PATCH 64/72] script/execute: Fix potential underflow and NULL
 dereference

The result is initialized to 0 in grub_script_arglist_to_argv().
If the for loop condition is not met both result.args and result.argc
remain 0 causing result.argc - 1 to underflow and/or result.args NULL
dereference. Fix the issues by adding relevant checks.

Fixes: CID 473880
