Subject: [PATCH] grub-set-bootflag: More complete fix for CVE-2024-1048

Switch to per-user fixed temporary filenames along with a weird locking
mechanism, which is explained in source code comments.  This is a more
complete fix than the previous commit (temporary files can't accumulate).
Unfortunately, it introduces new risks (by working on a temporary file
shared between the user's invocations), which are _hopefully_ avoided by
the patch's elaborate logic.  I actually got it wrong at first, which
suggests that this logic is hard to reason about, and more errors or
omissions are possible.  It also relies on the kernel's primitives' exact
semantics to a greater extent (nothing out of the ordinary, though).

Remaining issues that I think cannot reasonably be fixed without a
redesign (e.g., having per-flag files with nothing else in them) and
without introducing new issues:

A. A user can still revert a concurrent user's attempt of setting the
other flag - or of making other changes to grubenv by means other than
this program.

B. One leftover temporary file per user is still possible.
