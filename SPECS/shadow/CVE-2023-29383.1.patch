Subject: [PATCH] Overhaul valid_field()

e5905c4b ("Added control character check") introduced checking for
control characters but had the logic inverted, so it rejects all
characters that are not control ones.

Cast the character to `unsigned char` before passing to the character
checking functions to avoid UB.

Use strpbrk(3) for the illegal character test and return early.
