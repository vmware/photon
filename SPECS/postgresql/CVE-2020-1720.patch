Fix priv checks for ALTER <object> DEPENDS ON EXTENSION

Marking an object as dependant on an extension did not have any
privilege check whatsoever; this allowed any user to mark objects as
droppable by anyone able to DROP EXTENSION, which could be used to cause
system-wide havoc. Disallow by checking that the calling user owns the
mentioned object.

(No constraints are placed on the extension.)
