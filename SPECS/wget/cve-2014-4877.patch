Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Fix R7-2014-15: Arbitrary Symlink Access

Wget was susceptible to a symlink attack which could create arbitrary
files, directories or symbolic links and set their permissions when
retrieving a directory recursively through FTP. This commit changes the
default settings in Wget such that Wget no longer creates local symbolic
links, but rather traverses them and retrieves the pointed-to file in
such a retrieval.

The old behaviour can be attained by passing the --retr-symlinks=no
option to the Wget invokation command.

Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Add checks for valid listing file in FTP

When Wget retrieves a file through FTP, it first downloads a .listing
file and parses it for information about the files and other metadata.
Some servers may serve invalid .listing files. This patch checks for one
such known inconsistency wherein multiple lines in a listing file have
the same name. Such a filesystem is clearly not possible and hence we
eliminate duplicate entries here.
