Subject: [PATCH] libtls: Fix authentication bypass and expired pointer
 dereference

`public` is returned, but previously only if a trusted key was found.
We obviously don't want to return untrusted keys.  However, since the
reference is released after determining the key type, the returned
object also doesn't have the correct refcount.

So when the returned reference is released after verifying the TLS
signature, the public key object is actually destroyed.  The certificate
object then points to an expired pointer, which is dereferenced once it
itself is destroyed after the authentication is complete.  Depending on
whether the pointer is valid (i.e. points to memory allocated to the
process) and what was allocated there after the public key was freed,
this could result in a segmentation fault or even code execution.

Fixes: 63fd718915b5 ("libtls: call create_public_enumerator() with key_type")
Fixes: CVE-2023-26463
