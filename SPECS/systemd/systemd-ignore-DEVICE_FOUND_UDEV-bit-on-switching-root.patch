Subject: [PATCH] core/device: ignore DEVICE_FOUND_UDEV bit on switching root

The issue #12953 is caused by the following:
On switching root,
- deserialized_found == DEVICE_FOUND_UDEV | DEVICE_FOUND_MOUNT,
- deserialized_state == DEVICE_PLUGGED,
- enumerated_found == DEVICE_FOUND_MOUNT,
On switching root, most devices are not found by the enumeration process.
Hence, the device state is set to plugged by device_coldplug(), and then
changed to the dead state in device_catchup(). So the corresponding
mount point is unmounted. Later when the device is processed by udevd, it
will be changed to plugged state again.

The issue #23208 is caused by the fact that generated udev database in
initramfs and the main system are often different.

So, the two issues have the same root; we should not honor
DEVICE_FOUND_UDEV bit in the deserialized_found on switching root.

This partially reverts c6e892bc0eebe1d42c282bd2d8bae149fbeba85f.

Fixes #12953 and #23208.
Replaces #23215.

+         *   Also, there is no deserialized device. Device units are (a) generated based on dependencies of
+         *   other units, or (b) generated when uevents are received.
+         *
+         * - On switch-root, the udev databse may be cleared, except for devices with sticky bit, i.e.
+         *   OPTIONS="db_persist". Hence, almost no devices are enumerated in the step 2. However, in general,
+         *   we have several serialized devices. So, DEVICE_FOUND_UDEV bit in the deserialized_found must be
+         *   ignored, as udev rules in initramfs and the main system are often different. If the deserialized
+         *   state is DEVICE_PLUGGED, we need to downgrade it to DEVICE_TENTATIVE (or DEVICE_DEAD if nobody
+         *   sees the device). Unlike the other starting mode, Manager.honor_device_enumeration == false
+         *   (maybe, it is better to rename the flag) when device_coldplug() and device_catchup() are called.
+         *   Hence, let's conditionalize the operations by using the flag. After switch-root, systemd-udevd
+         *   will (re-)process all devices, and the Device.found and Device.state will be adjusted.
+         *
+         * - On reload or reexecute, we can trust enumerated_found, deserialized_found, and deserialized_state.
+         *   Of course, deserialized parameters may be outdated, but the unit state can be adjusted later by
