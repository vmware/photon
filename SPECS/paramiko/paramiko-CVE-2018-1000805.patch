 =========
 
 * :release:`1.17.6 <2018-03-12>`
+- :bug:`1283 (1.17+)` Fix exploit (CVE-2018-1000805) in Paramiko's server mode
+  (**not** client mode) where hostile clients could trick the server into
+  thinking they were authenticated without actually submitting valid
+  authentication.
+
+  Specifically, steps have been taken to start separating client and server
+  related message types in the message handling tables within ``Transport`` and
+  ``AuthHandler``; this work is not complete but enough has been performed to
+  close off this particular exploit (which was the only obvious such exploit
+  for this particular channel).
+
+  Thanks to Daniel Hoffman for the detailed report.
 * :bug:`1175 (1.17+)` Fix a security flaw (CVE-2018-7750) in Paramiko's server
   mode (emphasis on **server** mode; this does **not** impact *client* use!)
   where authentication status was not checked before processing channel-open
