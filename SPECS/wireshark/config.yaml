      detailed_description: 'Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer. It allows examining
        data from a live network or from a capture file on disk. You can interactively
        browse the capture data, viewing summary and detailed information for each
        packet. Wireshark has several features, including a rich display filter language
        and the ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session. '
