Subject: [PATCH] CHANGES: snmpd: recover SET status from delegated request

Reported by: Yu Zhang of VARAS@IIE, Nanyu Zhong of VARAS@IIE
Fixes by: Arista Networks

When a SET request includes a mix of delegated and
non-delegated requests (e.g., objects handled by master
agent and agentx sub-agent), the status can get lost while
waiting for the reply from the sub-agent.  Recover the status
into the session from the requests even if it has already
been processed.
