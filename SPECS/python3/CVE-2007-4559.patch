+
+Extraction filters
+------------------
+
+.. versionadded:: 3.7.17
+
+The *tar* format is designed to capture all details of a UNIX-like filesystem,
+which makes it very powerful.
+Unfortunately, the features make it easy to create tar files that have
+unintended -- and possibly malicious -- effects when extracted.
+For example, extracting a tar file can overwrite arbitrary files in various
+ways (e.g.  by using absolute paths, ``..`` path components, or symlinks that
+affect later members).
+
+In most cases, the full functionality is not needed.
+Therefore, *tarfile* supports extraction filters: a mechanism to limit
+functionality, and thus mitigate some of the security issues.
+
+.. seealso::
+
+   :pep:`706`
+      Contains further motivation and rationale behind the design.
+
+The *filter* argument to :meth:`TarFile.extract` or :meth:`~TarFile.extractall`
+can be:
+
+* the string ``'fully_trusted'``: Honor all metadata as specified in the
+  archive.
+  Should be used if the user trusts the archive completely, or implements
+  their own complex verification.
+
+* the string ``'tar'``: Honor most *tar*-specific features (i.e. features of
+  UNIX-like filesystems), but block features that are very likely to be
+  surprising or malicious. See :func:`tar_filter` for details.
+
+* the string ``'data'``: Ignore or block most features specific to UNIX-like
+  filesystems. Intended for extracting cross-platform data archives.
+  See :func:`data_filter` for details.
+
+* ``None`` (default): Use :attr:`TarFile.extraction_filter`.
+
+  If that is also ``None`` (the default), the ``'fully_trusted'``
+  filter will be used (for compatibility with earlier versions of Python).
+
+  In Python 3.12, the default will emit a ``DeprecationWarning``.
+
+  In Python 3.14, the ``'data'`` filter will become the default instead.
+  It's possible to switch earlier; see :attr:`TarFile.extraction_filter`.
+
+* A callable which will be called for each extracted member with a
+  :ref:`TarInfo <tarinfo-objects>` describing the member and the destination
+  path to where the archive is extracted (i.e. the same path is used for all
+  members)::
+
+      filter(/, member: TarInfo, path: str) -> TarInfo | None
+
+  The callable is called just before each member is extracted, so it can
+  take the current state of the disk into account.
+  It can:
+
+  - return a :class:`TarInfo` object which will be used instead of the metadata
+    in the archive, or
+  - return ``None``, in which case the member will be skipped, or
+  - raise an exception to abort the operation or skip the member,
+    depending on :attr:`~TarFile.errorlevel`.
+    Note that when extraction is aborted, :meth:`~TarFile.extractall` may leave
+    the archive partially extracted. It does not attempt to clean up.
+
+Default named filters
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The pre-defined, named filters are available as functions, so they can be
+reused in custom filters:
+
+.. function:: fully_trusted_filter(/, member, path)
+
+   Return *member* unchanged.
+
+   This implements the ``'fully_trusted'`` filter.
+
+.. function:: tar_filter(/, member, path)
+
+  Implements the ``'tar'`` filter.
+
+  - Strip leading slashes (``/`` and :attr:`os.sep`) from filenames.
+  - :ref:`Refuse <tarfile-extraction-refuse>` to extract files with absolute
+    paths (in case the name is absolute
+    even after stripping slashes, e.g. ``C:/foo`` on Windows).
+    This raises :class:`~tarfile.AbsolutePathError`.
+  - :ref:`Refuse <tarfile-extraction-refuse>` to extract files whose absolute
+    path (after following symlinks) would end up outside the destination.
+    This raises :class:`~tarfile.OutsideDestinationError`.
+  - Clear high mode bits (setuid, setgid, sticky) and group/other write bits
+    (:attr:`~stat.S_IWGRP`|:attr:`~stat.S_IWOTH`).
+
+  Return the modified ``TarInfo`` member.
+
+.. function:: data_filter(/, member, path)
+
+  Implements the ``'data'`` filter.
+  In addition to what ``tar_filter`` does:
+
+  - :ref:`Refuse <tarfile-extraction-refuse>` to extract links (hard or soft)
+    that link to absolute paths, or ones that link outside the destination.
+
+    This raises :class:`~tarfile.AbsoluteLinkError` or
+    :class:`~tarfile.LinkOutsideDestinationError`.
+
+    Note that such files are refused even on platforms that do not support
+    symbolic links.
+
+  - :ref:`Refuse <tarfile-extraction-refuse>` to extract device files
+    (including pipes).
+    This raises :class:`~tarfile.SpecialFileError`.
+
+  - For regular files, including hard links:
+
+    - Set the owner read and write permissions
+      (:attr:`~stat.S_IRUSR`|:attr:`~stat.S_IWUSR`).
+    - Remove the group & other executable permission
+      (:attr:`~stat.S_IXGRP`|:attr:`~stat.S_IXOTH`)
+      if the owner doesn’t have it (:attr:`~stat.S_IXUSR`).
+
+  - For other files (directories), set ``mode`` to ``None``, so
+    that extraction methods skip applying permission bits.
+  - Set user and group info (``uid``, ``gid``, ``uname``, ``gname``)
+    to ``None``, so that extraction methods skip setting it.
+
+  Return the modified ``TarInfo`` member.
+
+
+.. _tarfile-extraction-refuse:
+
+Filter errors
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+When a filter refuses to extract a file, it will raise an appropriate exception,
+a subclass of :class:`~tarfile.FilterError`.
+This will abort the extraction if :attr:`TarFile.errorlevel` is 1 or more.
+With ``errorlevel=0`` the error will be logged and the member will be skipped,
+but extraction will continue.
+
+
+Hints for further verification
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Even with ``filter='data'``, *tarfile* is not suited for extracting untrusted
+files without prior inspection.
+Among other issues, the pre-defined filters do not prevent denial-of-service
+attacks. Users should do additional checks.
+
+Here is an incomplete list of things to consider:
+
+* Extract to a :func:`new temporary directory <tempfile.mkdtemp>`
+  to prevent e.g. exploiting pre-existing links, and to make it easier to
+  clean up after a failed extraction.
+* When working with untrusted data, use external (e.g. OS-level) limits on
+  disk, memory and CPU usage.
+* Check filenames against an allow-list of characters
+  (to filter out control characters, confusables, foreign path separators,
+  etc.).
+* Check that filenames have expected extensions (discouraging files that
+  execute when you “click on them”, or extension-less files like Windows special device names).
+* Limit the number of extracted files, total size of extracted data,
+  filename length (including symlink length), and size of individual files.
+* Check for files that would be shadowed on case-insensitive filesystems.
+
+Also note that:
+
+* Tar files may contain multiple versions of the same file.
+  Later ones are expected to overwrite any earlier ones.
+  This feature is crucial to allow updating tape archives, but can be abused
+  maliciously.
+* *tarfile* does not protect against issues with “live” data,
+  e.g. an attacker tinkering with the destination (or source) directory while
+  extraction (or archiving) is in progress.
+
+
+Supporting older Python versions
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Extraction filters were added to Python 3.12, and are backported to older
+versions as security updates.
+To check whether the feature is available, use e.g.
+``hasattr(tarfile, 'data_filter')`` rather than checking the Python version.
+
+The following examples show how to support Python versions with and without
+the feature.
+Note that setting ``extraction_filter`` will affect any subsequent operations.
+
+* Fully trusted archive::
+
+    my_tarfile.extraction_filter = (lambda member, path: member)
+    my_tarfile.extractall()
+
+* Use the ``'data'`` filter if available, but revert to Python 3.11 behavior
+  (``'fully_trusted'``) if this feature is not available::
+
+    my_tarfile.extraction_filter = getattr(tarfile, 'data_filter',
+                                           (lambda member, path: member))
+    my_tarfile.extractall()
+
+* Use the ``'data'`` filter; *fail* if it is not available::
+
+    my_tarfile.extractall(filter=tarfile.data_filter)
+
+  or::
+
+    my_tarfile.extraction_filter = tarfile.data_filter
+    my_tarfile.extractall()
+
+* Use the ``'data'`` filter; *warn* if it is not available::
+
+   if hasattr(tarfile, 'data_filter'):
+       my_tarfile.extractall(filter='data')
+   else:
+       # remove this when no longer needed
+       warn_the_user('Extracting may be unsafe; consider updating Python')
+       my_tarfile.extractall()
+
+
+Stateful extraction filter example
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+While *tarfile*'s extraction methods take a simple *filter* callable,
+custom filters may be more complex objects with an internal state.
+It may be useful to write these as context managers, to be used like this::
+
+    with StatefulFilter() as filter_func:
+        tar.extractall(path, filter=filter_func)
+
+Such a filter can be written as, for example::
+
+    class StatefulFilter:
+        def __init__(self):
+            self.file_count = 0
+
+        def __enter__(self):
+            return self
+
+        def __call__(self, member, path):
+            self.file_count += 1
+            return member
+
+        def __exit__(self, *exc_info):
+            print(f'{self.file_count} files extracted')

+=========================

+tarfile
+-------
+
+* The extraction methods in :mod:`tarfile`, and :func:`shutil.unpack_archive`,
+  have a new a *filter* argument that allows limiting tar features than may be
+  surprising or dangerous, such as creating files outside the destination
+  directory.
+  See :ref:`tarfile-extraction-filter` for details.
+  In Python 3.12, use without the *filter* argument will show a
+  :exc:`DeprecationWarning`.
+  In Python 3.14, the default will switch to ``'data'``.
