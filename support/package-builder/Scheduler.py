        #

        # install-requires 'D'. Package 'D' build-requires 'E' and

        # dependencies"). The optimized graph for the example below is

        # graph is that every child package *MUST* be built before its
        # parent(s). This process helps relax package dependencies to
        # a great extent, by giving us the flexibility to delay
        # building certain packages until they are actually needed.

        # nullifies certain dependencies altogether (eg: A->B), thereby
        # enabling a greater level of build-parallelism.

        # individual weights of each package in their respective
        # chains.
