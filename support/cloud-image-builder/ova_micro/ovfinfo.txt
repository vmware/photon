conditions of this EULA and any breach of this EULA by a Third Party 
Agent shall be deemed to be a breach by You. 

2.3       Copying Permitted.  You may copy the Software and 
Documentation as necessary to install and run the quantity of copies 
licensed, but otherwise for archival purposes only. 

2.4	Benchmarking.  You may use the Software to conduct internal 
performance testing and benchmarking studies. You may only publish or 
otherwise distribute the results of such studies to third parties as follows:

express right to do so to obtain information necessary to render the 
Software interoperable with other software; provided, however, You must

requested information to allow VMware to assess Your claim, and VMware 
may, in its discretion, either provide such interoperability information to 
You, impose reasonable conditions, including a reasonable fee, on such 
use of the Software, or offer to provide alternatives to ensure that 
VMware's proprietary rights in the Software are protected and to reduce 
any adverse impact on VMware's proprietary rights.

3.3	Ownership.  The Software and Documentation, all copies and 
portions thereof, and all improvements, enhancements, modifications and

limited to those expressly granted in this EULA and any applicable Order.  
No other rights with respect to the Software or any related Intellectual 
Property Rights are implied.  You are not authorized to use (and shall not

the terms of this EULA. That audit is subject to reasonable notice by 
VMware and will not unreasonably interfere with Your business activities. 
VMware may conduct no more than one (1) audit in any twelve (12) month 
period, and only during normal business hours. You will reasonably 
cooperate with VMware and any third party auditor and will, without 
prejudice to other rights of VMware, address any non-compliance 
identified by the audit by promptly paying additional fees. You will promptly 
reimburse VMware for all reasonable costs of the audit if the audit reveals 
either underpayment of more than five (5%) percent of the Software fees 
payable by You for the period audited, or that You have materially failed to 
maintain accurate records of Software use. 

6.	SUPPORT AND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES.  Except as 
expressly specified in the Product Guide, VMware does not provide any 
support or subscription services for the Software under this EULA.  You

VMware support or subscription services.  These support or subscription 
services are subject to the Support Services Terms.

substantially conform to the applicable Documentation, provided that the 
Software: (a) has been properly installed and used at all times in 
accordance with the applicable Documentation; and (b) has not been 
modified or added to by persons other than VMware or its authorized 
representative. VMware will, at its own expense and as its sole obligation 
and Your exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, either replace 
that Software or correct any reproducible error in that Software reported to 
VMware by You in writing during the Warranty Period. If VMware 
determines that it is unable to correct the error or replace the Software, 
VMware will refund to You the amount paid by You for that Software, in 
which case the License for that Software will terminate.

7.2	Software Disclaimer of Warranty.  OTHER THAN THE 
WARRANTY ABOVE, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW, VMWARE AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO OTHER 
EXPRESS WARRANTIES UNDER THIS EULA, AND DISCLAIM ALL 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY 
WARRANTY ARISING BY STATUTE, OPERATION OF LAW, COURSE 
OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. VMWARE 
AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE 
WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT IT WILL BE FREE FROM 
DEFECTS OR THAT IT WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. 

8.	    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION. 

8.1	Defense and Indemnification.  Subject to the remainder of this 
Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification), VMware shall defend You 
against any third party claim that the Software infringes any patent, 
trademark or copyright of such third party, or misappropriates a trade 
secret (but only to the extent that the misappropriation is not a result of 
Your actions) under the laws of: (a) the United States and Canada; (b) the 
European Economic Area; (c) Australia; (d) New Zealand; (e) Japan; or (f) 
the People's Republic of China, to the extent that such countries are part 
of the Territory for the License ("Infringement Claim") and indemnify You 
from the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against You to such 
third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in settlement. 
The foregoing obligations are applicable only if You:  (i) promptly notify 
VMware in writing of the Infringement Claim; (ii) allow VMware sole control 
over the defense for the claim and any settlement negotiations; and (iii) 
reasonably cooperate in response to VMware requests for assistance.  
You may not settle or compromise any Infringement Claim without the 
prior written consent of VMware.
8.2	Remedies.  If the alleged infringing Software become, or in 
VMware's opinion be likely to become, the subject of an Infringement 
Claim, VMware will, at VMware's option and expense, do one of the 
following:  (a) procure the rights necessary for You to make continued use 
of the affected Software; (b) replace or modify the affected Software to 
make it non-infringing; or (c) terminate the License to the affected 
Software and discontinue the related support services, and, upon Your 
certified deletion of the affected Software, refund: (i) the fees paid by You 
for the License to the affected Software, less straight-line depreciation 
over a three (3) year useful life beginning on the date such Software was 
delivered; and (ii) any pre-paid service fee attributable to related support 
services to be delivered after the date such service is stopped. Nothing in 
this Section 8.2 (Remedies) shall limit VMware's obligation under Section 
8.1 (Defense and Indemnification) to defend and indemnify You, provided 
that You replace the allegedly infringing Software upon VMware's making 
alternate Software available to You and/or You discontinue using the 
allegedly infringing Software upon receiving VMware's notice terminating 
the affected License.
8.3	Exclusions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, VMware will have no 
obligation under this Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification) or 
otherwise with respect to any claim based on:  (a) a combination of 
Software with non-VMware products (other than non-VMware products 
that are listed on the Order and used in an unmodified form); (b) use for a 
purpose or in a manner for which the Software was not designed; (c) use 
of any older version of the Software when use of a newer VMware version 
would have avoided the infringement; (d) any modification to the Software 
made without VMware's express written approval; (e) any claim that 
relates to open source software or freeware technology or any derivatives 
or other adaptations thereof that is not embedded by VMware into 
Software listed on VMware's commercial price list; or (f) any Software 
provided on a no charge, beta or evaluation basis.  THIS SECTION 8

SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND VMWARE'S ENTIRE LIABILITY 
FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS OR ACTIONS. 

9.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,

OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, 
NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.  BECAUSE 
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL 
DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  
VMWARE'S AND ITS LICENSORS' LIABILITY UNDER THIS EULA WILL 
NOT, IN ANY EVENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS 
BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, 
EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE LICENSE FEES YOU PAID FOR THE 
SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR $5000. THE 
FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF 
WHETHER VMWARE OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF 
WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 

9.2	Further Limitations.  VMware's licensors shall have no liability of 
any kind under this EULA and VMware's liability with respect to any third 
party software embedded in the Software shall be subject to Section 9.1

purposes of this EULA and who are under a duty of confidentiality no less 
restrictive than Recipient's duty hereunder.  Recipient will protect 
Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in 
the same manner as Recipient protects its own confidential or proprietary 
information of a similar nature but with no less than reasonable care.
11.3	Exceptions.  Recipient's obligations under Section 11.2 (Protection) 
with respect to any Confidential Information will terminate if Recipient can 
show by written records that such information:  (a) was already known to 
Recipient at the time of disclosure by Discloser; (b) was disclosed to 
Recipient by a third party who had the right to make such disclosure 
without any confidentiality restrictions; (c) is, or through no fault of
