# Main Dockerfile of the project. It creates an image that serves the application. This image should
# be built from the dist directory.

# Taken from kubernetes-dashboard rpm, from /opt/k8sdashboard/Dockerfile
# Replace ubuntu image with photon:5.0
FROM photon:5.0 as builder

RUN tdnf install -y shadow --refresh
# Create a nonroot user for final image
RUN useradd -u 10001 nonroot

# Scratch can be used as the base image because the backend is compiled to include all
# its dependencies.
FROM scratch as final

# Add all files from current working directory to the root of the image, i.e., copy dist directory
# layout to the root directory.
