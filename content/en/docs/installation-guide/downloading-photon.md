|ISO Image|Contains everything needed to install the minimal or full installation of Photon OS or the Real-Time flavor of Photon OS. The bootable ISO has a manual installer or can be used with PXE/kickstart environments for automated installations.|
|OVA|Pre-installed minimal environment, customized for VMware hypervisor environments. These customizations include a highly sanitized and optimized kernel to give improved boot and runtime performance for containers and Linux applications. Since an OVA is a complete virtual machine definition, we've made available a Photon OS OVA that has virtual hardware version 13 arm64, version 13, and version 11; this will allow for compatibility with several versions of VMware platforms or allow for the latest and greatest virtual hardware enhancements.|
