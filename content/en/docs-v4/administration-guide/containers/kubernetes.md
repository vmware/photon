The Kubernetes package provides several services: kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, kubelet, kube-proxy. These services are managed by `systemd`. Their configuration resides in a central location: `/etc/kubernetes`.

For more information, see [Running Kubernetes on Photon OS](../../user-guide/kubernetes-on-photon-os/).
