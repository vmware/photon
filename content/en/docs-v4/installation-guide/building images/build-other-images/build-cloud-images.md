title:  Building Cloud Images
weight: 1
---

Perform the following steps to build the cloud images on Ubuntu: 

1. Install the packages: 

    ```
    sudo apt-get -y install bison gawk g++ createrepo python-aptdaemon genisoimage texinfo python-requests libfuse-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev libreadline-dev kpartx git bc
    ```

1. Get Docker:

    ```
    wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
    ```
 
1.  Install pip 
   
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    pip3 install git+https://github.com/vmware/photon-os-installer.git
    git clone https://github.com/vmware/photon.git
    ```
    
    If you encounter an error for LOCALE when you run these commands, then export the following variables in the terminal:
       
    `export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"`  
    `export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"`

1.  Clone the Photon project:
   
    `git clone https://github.com/vmware/photon.git`  
    `cd $HOME/workspaces/photon`

1. Make the cloud image for AMI. 
  
    `sudo make image IMG_NAME=ami`

1. Make the cloud image for Azure. 
    
    `sudo make image IMG_NAME=azure`

1. Make the cloud image for GCE. 
      
    `sudo make image IMG_NAME=gce`  
    

**Result**

This command first builds all RPMs corresponding to the SPEC files in your Photon repository and then builds a bootable ISO containing those RPMs.


The RPMs thus built are stored under `stage/RPMS/` directory within the repository, using the following directory hierarchy:

```
$HOME/workspaces/photon/stage/:
├──RPMS/:
    ├──noarch/*.noarch.rpm    [Architecture-independent RPMs]
    ├──x86_64/*.x86_64.rpm    [RPMs built for the x86-64 architecture]
    ├──aarch64/*.aarch64.rpm  [RPMs built for the aarch64 (ARM64) architecture]
```

The cloud image is created at `$HOME/workspaces/photon`.
