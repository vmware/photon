1. Download Photon OS. 

    To install Photon OS on a Raspberry Pi 3, you must download the Photon OS RPi3 image, which is distributed as a compressed raw disk image with the file extension `.raw.xz`. 
    
    **Note**: You cannot use the Photon ISO to install on RPi3. 
    
    Go to the following bintray URL and download the latest release of Photon OS image for RPi3: [https://packages.vmware.com/photon/3.0/GA/rpi3](https://packages.vmware.com/photon/3.0/GA/rpi3).
