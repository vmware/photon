You can use Photon OS as a virtual machine within VMware Fusion. You can download Photon OS, as an OVA or ISO file, and install the Photon OS distribution on Fusion. After you install Photon OS, you can deploy a containerized application in Docker with a single command.

**Note**: If you want to upgrade an existing Photon 1.0 VM, refer to the instructions in [Upgrading to Photon OS 3.0](../upgrading-to-photon-os-3.md).
