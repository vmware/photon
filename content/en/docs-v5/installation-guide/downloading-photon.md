|[ISO Image](https://packages.vmware.com/photon/5.0/GA/iso/)|Contains everything needed to install the minimal or full installation of Photon OS or the Real-Time flavor of Photon OS. The bootable ISO has a manual installer or can be used with PXE/kickstart environments for automated installations.|
|[OVA](https://packages.vmware.com/photon/5.0/GA/ova/)|Pre-installed minimal environment, customized for VMware hypervisor environments.
