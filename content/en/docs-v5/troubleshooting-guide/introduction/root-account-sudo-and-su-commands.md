title:  The Root Account and the `sudo` and `su` Commands
weight: 2

The *Troubleshooting Guide* assumes that you are logged in to Photon OS with the root account and running commands as root. The `sudo` program comes with the minimal and full version of Photon OS. As an alternative to use `sudo` on the minimal version, you can switch users as needed with the `su` command to run commands that require root privileges. In this case, the package can be removed with `tdnf remove sudo` if you don't want to use it.
