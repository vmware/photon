title:  Inspecting the Status of Network Links with 'networkctl'
weight: 11
---

You can inspect information about network connections by using the `networkctl` command. This can help you configure networking services and troubleshoot networking problems. 

You can progressively add options and arguments to the `networkctl` command to move from general information about network connections to specific information about a network connection. 

# networkctl Command Without Options

Run the `networkctl` command without options to default to the list command:  

```console
networkctl
IDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL  SETUP
  1 lo               loopback           carrier      unmanaged
  2 eth0             ether              routable     configured
  3 docker0          ether              routable     unmanaged
  11 vethb0aa7a6     ether              degraded     unmanaged
  4 links listed.
```

## 'networkctl status' Command

Run `networkctl` with the status command to display the following information:  

```console
root@photon-rc [ ~ ]# > networkctl status
   State: routable
  Address: 10.197.103.56 on eno1
           172.17.0.1 on docker0
           fe80::20c:29ff:fe44:f92c on eno1
  Gateway: 10.197.103.253 (Cisco Systems, Inc) on eno1
      DNS: 10.142.7.1
           10.132.7.1
           10.166.17.90
      NTP: 10.128.152.81
           10.166.1.120
           10.188.26.119
           10.84.55.42

```

You can see that there are active network links with IP addresses for not only the Ethernet connection but also a Docker container.


### 'networkctl status' Command With Network Link Option


You can add a network link, such as the Ethernet connection, as the argument of the `status` command to show specific information about the link: 

```console
	root@photon-rc [ ~ ]# networkctl status ens33
	* 2: ens33
	         Link File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link                                      
                  Network File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/10-eth.network                                       
                          Type: ether                                                                         
                         State: routable (configured)

### 'networkctl status' Command With Docker Option

You can add a Docker container as the argument of the `status` command to show specific information about the container: 
	
```console
networkctl status docker0
	* 3: docker0
	       Link File: /usr/lib/systemd/network/99-default.link
	    Network File: n/a
	            Type: ether
	           State: routable (unmanaged)
	          Driver: bridge
	      HW Address: 02:42:f0:f7:bd:81
	             MTU: 1500
	         Address: 172.17.0.1
	                  fe80::42:f0ff:fef7:bd81
```

In the example above, the state of the Docker container is unmanaged because Docker handles managing the networking for the containers without using systemd-resolved or systemd-networkd. Docker manages the container connection by using its bridge drive.
