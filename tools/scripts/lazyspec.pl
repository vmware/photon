=head1 NAME

  lazyspec.pl - A tool for the truly lazy SPEC file maintainer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  lazyspec.pl [OPTIONS] [SPEC1 [SPEC2, ...]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  lazyspec.pl is a script that allows automation of some common work-flows done on a SPEC file.

  It can automate the following actions:
    1. Adding a patch to fix CVEs in packages.
    2. Adding changelog and updating release numbers.
    3. Updating package versions.

  In addition, it can also,
    1. Check if all patches to a SPEC file can be applied.
    2. Make source tree out of a SPEC file.

=head1 OPTIONS

  -c, --cve CVE_NUMBER      CVE number for the issue being fixed. This is used to produce the patch
                            file name (unless, --keep-names is specified). It is also used to auto
                            generate changelog message (unless --message is provided) and comment
                            above the patch source entry.
  -p, --patch PATH          Path to patch file. Alternatively, a URL to patch file (raw) can also be
                            passed.
  -u, --upgrade-to VERSION  Upgrade spec file to VERSION. Must pass --source along with this option.
                            When this option is set to "latest", lazyspec will try to upgrade to the
                            latest version of that package. Currently, "latest" works only on
                            kernels.
  -s, --source PATH         Path to source tarball. Alternatively, a URL to the tarball can also be
                            passed.
  -m, --message MESSAGE     String that goes into the changelog entry of the spec file (also updates
                            release number). This can be handy if you have done some modifications
                            (manually), and just want to increment the release and put a changelog
                            entry.
  --kernels                 Instruct to perform some kernel spec specific optimizations. Also, when
                            this flag is passed, all kernel spec files are considered (instead of
                            having to pass them individually).
  --keep-names              Preserve patch file names (defaults to CVE-NUMBER.patch)
  --check                   Check the given spec files to see if all its patches (current) can be
                            applied on its source. This will also try to guess if a patch is made
                            redundant (already incorporated) in current source tarball. This is
                            useful soon after a --upgrade-to action especially in packages that have
                            many patches with frequent upgrades such as in the kernels.
  --make-tree               Create a source tree based on the details extracted from the spec file.
                            The source tree produced, resides in /tmp and includes all patches
                            applied by that spec file. This command can operate only on one spec
                            file at a time.
  --man                     Display the full man page for this tool.
  -h, --help                Print a short help text.

=head1 EXAMPLES

    1. Apply a patch from github to a spec file

        lazyspec.pl --cve CVE-2020-12345 \
                    --patch https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/commit/62aec83ed84cc20cc6edbf17e4c518ee1dfd16af.patch \
                    SPECS/yarn/yarn.spec

    2. Add changelog to any package:

        lazyspec.pl --message "This text will appear in the changelog" \
                    SPEC/iptables/iptables.spec

    3. Add a patch to all kernels:

        lazyspec.pl --cve CVE-2020-12345 \
                    --patch kvm-dont-accept-wrong-gsi-values.patch \
                    --kernels --keep-names

    4. Upgrade kernels to latest version

        lazyspec.pl --upgrade-to latest --kernels

    5. Upgrade kernels to a specific version

        lazyspec.pl --upgrade-to 4.19.121 \
                    --source https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.19.121.tar.xz \
                    --kernels

    6. Check patches to a package:

        lazyspec.pl --check --kernels
        lazyspec.pl --check SPECS/kubernetes/kubernetes-1.14.spec

    7. Created a source tree for a package with all its patches applied:

        lazyspec.pl --make-tree SPEC/linux/linux-rt.spec

=head1 BUGS

  Due to the nature of problem this tool tries to solve, be warned that there can be issues when run
  on an arbitrary SPEC file. Report bugs identified to the MAINTAINERS.
